0, I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer ,0
1,No Negative,0
2, Rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps So ask for single level Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge ,0
3, My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep ,0
4, You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again ,0
5, Backyard of the hotel is total mess shouldn t happen in hotel with 4 stars ,0
6, Cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed They also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it ,0
7, Apart from the price for the brekfast Everything very good,0
8, Even though the pictures show very clean rooms the actual room was quit dirty and outlived Also check in is at 15 o clock but our room was not ready at that time,0
9, The aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night ,0
10, Nothing all great ,0
11, 6 30 AM started big noise workers loading wood down the windows Stupid room numbering system it took 20 Minutes with a night guard finally to find our rooms The check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction No late dinner bar closes at 1 am Ugly view on trash lorry from windows No information about the computerized telephone Huge price difference between booking Com price 166 euros and hotel price 260 ,0
12, The floor in my room was filfy dirty Very basic rooms I had a 20yr old tv in my room Fridge did not work Overpriced breakfast ,0
13,No Negative,0
14, The staff in the restaurant could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him ,0
15,No Negative,0
16, Very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children I asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one Room decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse,0
17, We did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this The room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment ,0
18,No Negative,0
19, We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely ,0
20, Bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase No USB port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s Some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous Some corridors were poorly lit ,0
21, Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery ,0
22, Sadly I cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me When we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing ,0
23, Transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner ,0
24, Nothing ,0
25, The bathroom in our room was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv ,0
26, Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all ,0
27, Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you ,0
28, We had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom ,0
29, There is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel The hotel s restaurant is nice but overpriced The bathroom is not very practical ,0
30, Little bit on the pricey side,0
31, Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective ,0
32, Our bathroom had an urine order Shower was very slippery No shower chair handles or bars Bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off Very expensive and breakfast was not included Construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it There was a park and that was nice Not close to town or museums ,0
33, Please see above,0
34, The rooms were cold Although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming It could use some design help an area rug or two ,0
35, Construction on site but not mentioned on booking com The breakfast can be improved it is quite expensive for its quality ,0
36, not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my breakfast poor signs for temporary reception during renovation,0
37, The glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is a weird solution for double It is necessary to darken the glasses much more ,0
38, the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the Hotel I suppose if there is one thing the room I had did not have a view only other rooms but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that,0
39, Staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective Every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say I don t know the answer let me find out for you There didn t seem to be a manager around Unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished The temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad Breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet ,0
40, Several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around Also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows This is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy ,0
41, Hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair Rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love First room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area Shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes We requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than 5 minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading Fault reported but not rectified during our stay The building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate ,0
42, Hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process Staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although I prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino Room was huge 3 4 meter high ceilings and freezing cold Heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room Was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature Forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium And for all that I paid 250 Never again ,0
43, Water pressure in my shower was no existent Feel bad even saying that ,0
44, The service was awful They refused to take ownership of a mistake on their part even after being asked about it in the morning ,0
45, Bathroom lighting could have been brighter The airconditioning of our room 303 could not be turned down lower than 23 degrees celcius The refrigerator in our room was not cooling there was no thermostat The toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either ,0
46, The hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when I booked it or at any point until we arrived there We then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby The room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private Showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky Amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which I first discovered with my barefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and I definitely would have stayed somewhere else ,0
47, The hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram The hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups ,0
48,No Negative,0
49, Service horrible Pillows super stiff and big could break your neck Room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything Door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened Service in general was poor I would not stay here,0
50, The bar was shut when I got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a Saturday night in a city like Amsterdam ,0
51, When arriving I was told I had to pay 19 city tax That wasn t shown on the policies I pre paid extra for there to be petals on the bed there were no petals The sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the bed didn t even sweep the floor When checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us We waited 30 minutes after 15 we asked how long it would be she said I will check she said that twice Made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight Wasn t happy at all ,0
52, I loved everything ,0
53,No Negative,0
54, when you take a shower the whole floor is in the water problem with opening the garage door curtained window some construction,0
55,No Negative,0
56, there was construction work going on in the hotel which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the bar staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at 11 30pm despite at check in being told the bar was open until 12 mid night ,0
57, Some building work was being carried out during our stay which was noisy but obviously unavoidable stairs in our room were very narrow and steep which meant getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet was a real task ,0
58, The hotel is under renovation so even though it was in a park our view was of scaffolding Also the bed would benefit from more pillows blankets Personal preference ,0
59,No Negative,0
60, The place is completely mismanaged The property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice Don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service The restaurant service is the worst I have ever experienced The staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently The hotel has many strange design choices too Had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet Shower overflows all over bathroom quickly You can see into the urinals from the reception area Loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly Put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs This is the only negative review I have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management ,0
61, The bathroom if someone took shower because it will flow over to the elevated floor ,0
62, Soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear Service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again ,0
63, Very bad attitude of personnel at Breakfast Only allowed one coffee from the Coffee machine filter coffee was free Rude behavior of the manager Room was noisy because of dripping water sound heater system in room ,0
64, The bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe ,0
65, Not being told a hedkandi night was across from our room leaving us with no sleep Room could have been allocated to someone attending the night instead of us Just bad organisation on room allocation ,0
66, Asked for more coffee and sugars only got given two satchets of each Room cleaned floor not hovered as the rug was very messy Wifi worked for half a morning then never connected again for the whole trip ,0
67, Room was not cleaned correctly Wine Champagne glasses left dirty in the room the floors felt dirty and the shower drain was clogged From the day we arrived ,0
68, The bathroom was amazing Though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times They should think about a screen or opaque glass ,0
69, Our room didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the room Didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues I would recommend the hotel to anyone ,0
70, The breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized The young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests This was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out I would expect a better experience for that price ,0
71, Breakfast I missed cutted fresh fruits for Muesli couldn t find the Cheese and for Capuccino you had to pay extra ,0
72, The sink in the bathroom was very dirty when I got the room Unacceptable The room was freezing cold they could turn on the heating before the guests arrive ,0
73, upgraded on arrival very good but unfortunately lovely room had a smell of cigarettes mixed with perfume so changed room next room in attic annexe very cold offered a heater but asked to change again back to regular sized room perfectly adequate as on my own and comfortable but bothered by traffic noise from main road outside ,0
74, If you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel The glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty Nearly all the guests we came across we re British but there was a complete lack of English Breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast What made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast The hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time Which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast ,0
75,No Negative,0
76, The hotel is undergoing massive construction with workers all around and this was not indicated at the time of booking We had a rodent in the room one night due to the disturbance of construction ,0
77, Rooms were a little louder than we would have liked A lot of noise from people walking by and shutting doors ,0
78,No Negative,0
79,No Negative,0
80, The hotel is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large room but really it was not worth the money ,0
81, I can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy ,0
82, The cleaniness of the rooms can be better Check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub Also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room Some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too Restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up And cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel ,0
83, Wasn t told about renovations going on staff in the restaurant very slow ask to order got told table service then when they did come over were told the restaurant had closed The man covering the night shift wasn t very helpful ,0
84, The hotel is currently being renovated Being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your room or in the rooms above Mini Bar empty No remote for the TV Heating direct above the bed and quite noisy ,0
85, Initial room was small but we were quickly swapped into a bettet room without fuss,0
86, That I wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works We had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments When walking around there was nobody very empty feel ,0
87, Maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it Leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping Stained carpet Not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from 2 3m high Not much useful information No minibar Understaffed reception long wait ,0
88, No ground floor room as requested 2 months ago first room totally freezing etc restaurant under par Much better last time we stayed Prices gone up ,0
89, We booked 3 twins and were given 2 and a double which they couldn t change Not happy Plus bathroom had a horrible smell coming from the drain ,0
90, Even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at breakfast was very poor Shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done ,0
91, The room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon Having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere ,0
92, In a terrible state with builders everywhere We had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door Our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair ,0
93, So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately The hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms,0
94, There were Construction Works and such information was not passed to us when we booked There was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower Too dark common reas ,0
95, The work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival Will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate ,0
96,No Negative,0
97, Our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building However the design tried to maximise its quirky layout ,0
98, Got charged 50 for a birthday package when it was advertised for 30 on the website This was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of The shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use We were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower Couldn t check us into our room at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes Standard Breakfast was very expensive at 17 I highly suggest not to buy Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use Overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend ,0
99, split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical 1 TV remote for both tv s but on differernt floors A C is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust The walls are also very thin not good sound proofing ,0
100, Building work starting at 7am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance Also air conditioning very very loud,0
101, Hotel is having some construction work done this I can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not 4 star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down I thought,0
102, There was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant ,0
103, it s a shame about all the construction going on because it looked like such a beautiful place but we couldn t see a lot ,0
104, Building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle ,0
105, Construction during the day though not intrusive,0
106, The front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable Breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined ,0
107, No Limited A C in common areas Dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters Musty smell throughout common areas Deluxe rooms very small impractical design Impractical shower design no place for soap Poor quality bed mattress Room refrigerator barely worked Food in restaurant overprices only fair quality Overall dark rundown dreary appearance,0
108, There was a loud noise outside my room on the first night like a generator Perhaps it had to do with the renewal works in place ,0
109, The hotel is under reconstruction although it didn t affect us Overall it s a lovely hotel very spacious ,0
110, there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view,0
111, Staff promised things they didn t deliver Room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant ,0
112,No Negative,0
113,No Negative,0
114,No Negative,0
115, We would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated We had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel ,0
116, I wouldnt be able to recommend my grandparents as there are stairs in our room i also dont remember reading that there are stairs in the room although its fine for us as we are only 20 ,0
117, The outside of the hotel is under construction It will look beautiful when it s done ,0
118, the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times The bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering The staff member who checked us in charged us a 150 security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment Check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware ,0
119, The hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation The sidewalk entrance was a mess There was no mention of this at all on the booking com website We were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation Not good enough ,0
120, Major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion Room on 2 levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience After complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level Food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare Despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend ,0
121, The first room had steep steps to a loft bed Not practical and dangerous for someone 68 especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night Second night had a room on one level ,0
122, The bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all The room size was also pretty small ,0
123, Our suite on the 3 floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle The staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered For the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed,0
124, The shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster The room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges The bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare The stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids You definitely get what you pay for It was half clean and not very central,0
125, Overpriced breakfast Bed too soft Bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on Building works impact on overall good impression ,0
126, We were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in 3 days We had to ask for more towels We ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after 3 mouthfuls my friend was sick ,0
127, We did have what looked like blood splashes all up the top of our curtains Told reception but nothing was done about it It definitely didn t put us of our stay and wouldn t stop us going back ,0
128, The bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to The lighting in the halls was too dim ,0
129, We had one of our items we bought taken possibly mistaken as rubbish even though this wasn t in the bin no where near the bin and next to other gifts we bought We told reception but nothing came of it Very disappointing as this made us feel our other belonging where not safe in the hotel from there on ,0
130, Two storey room with narrow winding stairs Wet room d cor and functionality Lack of storage space,0
131, There was a staircase in our room between the bed and the bathroom This means the bathroom is very spacious and lovely but can be a bit of a pain in the middle of the night ,0
132, It would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor It was noisy from the main street It was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes There was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this I am sure it will be very nice when it is finished ,0
133, First impressions of the dark reception made us wary to begin with Also we were given a duplex suite to start with Dutch stairs are very steep and we asked to change rooms which staff were most accommodating about The hotel is being renovated externally but this didn t affect our stay at all ,0
134, Foyer was a mess Only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two We had a very cold spell and it was draughty The first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over 30 or afraid of hights The second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair The hotel states it is four star but is not It feels like a up graded backpackers It is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max I thought I was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was The hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking It was very disappointing and embarrassing as I had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with Very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms ,0
135, the club sandwiches cold bacon with congealed fat and processed chicken Very poor ,0
136, The only complaint we had was the iron in the room was not a steam iron and it was travel size which did not work particularly well ,0
137, There was a little construction at the time but we were compensated with a free drink and room well away from the work ,0
138, Building working next to entrance wooden platform to door looked unwelcoming Gothic look of reception area Checking out at 11 30am Wooden beam at one side of bed bloking your way See through glass to shower ,0
139, We didn t like our first room the stairs in the duplex were very steep and narrow ,0
140,No Negative,0
141, The fact I had to leave,0
142, The d cor but hotel is currently being extended I expect the d cor will be updated when this is finished ,0
143, The interiors are looking quite tired and the deluxe room on two levels was not to our liking This hotel was listed as four star though we would not consider this an accurate rating ,0
144, Currently have building work in the complex This didn t affect our stay as we heard nothing but visually not ideal when you arrive ,0
145, Stairs in our room were too narrow and steep No where did it say hotel was undergoing extensive building work and room looked out onto main busy road ,0
146, We booked a 3 night stay in a suite On arrival the room was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places During the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the room at 0630 I went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened It turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our room He came to apologise with a feeble excuse I tripped and fell into the door We didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us I asked her to remove my credit card from the room security deposit to which she assured me it was We went to a far better hotel and thought the matter was done with No it wasn t I came home to find my credit card had been charged 420 from them I phoned them up to complain and the money was returned However I have lost about 30 in bank charges due to their incompetence Terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel ,0
147, The noise of the construction works that began at 7am sharp in the mornings The see through toilet bathroom the shabby sinks and sandpaper like tissue paper ,0
148, The hotel is currently under going renovations and while this wasnt a major problem work did start early on Mon morning ,0
149, There were construction works at the front of the hotel but this didn t make much impact when inside However in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that I can only put down to the work outside It was abit gross but once we were by the actual rooms any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely Considering it was a 4 star the room could have been abit neater ie The corners of the room were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major ,0
150, More sofas needed in the bar better breakfast options water pressure in the shower was rubbish really noisy on the road no difference between open or closed Windows soft closing doors are needed room was way too hot and unable to turn the heat down No mention of the building work going on ,0
151, When we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for Once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple Also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste ,0
152, Room 240 should be discontinued It is really too small and only upsets your Customers Breakfast okay but choices a little limited compared to others You could add seeds more fruit etc at very little extra cost ,0
153, Could hear music being played by the people in the next door room late at night ,0
154,No Negative,0
155, The cleanness was quite poor A lot of dust under the bed under the furniture on top of the bed side lamps the remote control and even the plastic glasses in the bathroom were dirty Also something went wrong with the pipes of the shower a horrible smell came out at night ,0
156, Being given a ridiculously small room initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely Building work being undertaken all round the hotel the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink I d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the bar later that evening If you are going to compensate do it properly ,0
157, The first night we got there we where put in a room where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom I raised this with the staff and was given another room However we where there 3 days and the housekeeping is shocking They do not clean rooms properly but most importantly no clean bed sheets They just come make ur bed that s all Same cups same rubbish it s disgusting Please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy DO NOT book this hotel their rooms are designed in such a way they are not practical Glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the room which was really annoying we had a room where I could see the toilet from the bed Other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid ,0
158, I hate when the beds are two separate beds pushed together That may just be a European thing or maybe I got the reservation wrong either way I would still go back to this hotel,0
159, the hotel was in a bad condition Not really clean and everything was worn out Breakfast was barely OK and room service dinner was bad low quality and cold when I got it Hotel Arena doesnt deliver what its four stars promise ,0
160, Rooms could have been a little cleaner and better maintained ,0
161, The hotel looked abit tired lots of scratches and market on the walls the floors in the room looked a little dirty and our room smelt very bad of dirty drains so bad we actually moved rooms,0
162, The room we were given originally wasn t very clean there was a problem with the floor which was unsafe they said they didn t have time to get this fixed before my stay which I thought was poor No bath in room even though I requested one on booking,0
163, Radiator in bedroom needed bleeding but really not a problem ,0
164, Location is a little far from centre the hotel is tired it needs a bit of money spending on it polish it up and make feel new again as it doesn t feel new it feels tired ,0
165, Room could have done with a microwave our room had a small leak in the walls from where the rain would come through ,0
166, The hotel was incorrectly informed about my room type booking Building work within the grounds worth mentioning but is not is noisy or obtrusive ,0
167, The shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back The room could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the hotel was surrounded by construction works But very good value for money ,0
168,No Negative,0
169, Nothing One Of The Receptionist she did a racist comment regarding My accent and my country The housekeeping Didnt like was a disaster Enter in The room Without knock The door a tall girl ,0
170, Breakfast was crazy expensive Location required about a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway Construction is underway for a massive expansion project so there was some noise during the day ,0
171, The location isn t great bit far out from the centre and area surrounding hotel looks rough The hotel looked out of place there When upgrading to a suite with bathtub extra 25 one of the pillows was filthy A call to reception and a new pillow arrived within the hour But still not what you would expect Room service is very expensive and not good quality or as described on the menu ,0
172, Hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all 4 of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked 2 separate rooms for a reason we booked 2 double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in 2 twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the 500 pound that was spent ,0
173, the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over 3 days must of been greeted and welcomed by 8 different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking,0
174,No Negative,0
175, The bathroom door was hanging off the light fitting fell off from above the bed there were marks on the wall and ceiling where flys had been squashed against it but not washed off afterwards ,0
176, We didn t have a bad experience ,0
177, Only complaint would be walls are a little thin and could hear next door but not a major issue,0
178,No Negative,0
179, Breakfast not included in the price and whilst it was good we feel it was on the expensive side Split level room that we had wasn t in our view very practical although others may like it ,0
180, They charged all our bank cards at the beginning of our stay and the money is then returned if you pay by a different means Unfortunately they charged 2 of us twice and we are still waiting for the money to be returned a week later Just spoilt it for us as we have been chasing our money back,0
181, When I arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before I booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done All the lovely garden had been tourn up Then the next morning I got rudely awakened at 6 45 7 00 by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so That s probably why I wouldn t stay at hotel arena again I was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full English breakfasts ,0
182, Finding no car park when I had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying There was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way The staff were a bit abrupt not really listening I asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening I called reception They said one coming very soon I had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told Some time later I had said I wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten I took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before The answer was no but we could have a fan I said no because I did not want to risk waiting ,0
183, The shower has no curtain whatsoever so the water just spills over the whole bathroom ,0
184, The location unfortunately were a bit far from the center 20 min by tramp ,0
185, The fact that building work meant the nightclub and half hotel were closed Woken by builders two mornings at 7am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion ,0
186, Breakfast was expensive and hotel could have benefited with a Gym Swimming pool,0
187, The hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside During working hours the noise can be very disturbing The facilities look and sound rickety The A C is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold What s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls Chinese water torture anyone The bathroom walls are transparent And I don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint I mean Oh my word I didn t want to see that There is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom The staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them 3 days in a row with no new towels The hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it If you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead Or another hotel ,0
188, The bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass Not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy Considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar I thought this was a nice gesture until I was repeatedly told I can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or 25cl beer You might have well not bothered Hotel Arena It was more like an insult ,0
189, the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at 6am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when I reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working I stayed there 14 days never again ,0
190, In our own experience First night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the AC The next day we were moved to a better room ok but I was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t AC was very noisy also in the new room And last At reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost 44Euro After doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us 55 Euro The driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception Be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from Arena,0
191, Arena hotel is located in a historical building and definitely needs to be renovated On the territory of the hotel just at the main entrance there are construction works Standard rooms have stairs beds are on the upper level The space of the lower level is very small 50 of it is bathroom No cafes and supermarkets in the nearby No minibar in room only at reception Arena is hardly a 4 star hotel in reality it can be regarded as a 3 hotel only ,0
192, Reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful ,0
193, Cost of taxi to the airport said it would cost 55 euros driver charged us 78 euros But only payed 45 euros from the airport to the hotel,0
194, No plug with washbasin Staff did not think this was a problem though I did Had to change from ground floor room where bed was up a very steep ladder on a mezzanine ,0
195, the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants ,0
196, The toilet has glass walls no privacy The room was dirty after 3 days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small I don t understand how this hotel has 4 stars The day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at 8 30 because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel ,0
197, Partially frosted glass door into bathroom was both a tad noisy and a bit too sharing ,0
198,No Negative,0
199, Room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived We found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned In addition the daily cleaning was very basic Unacceptable for an hotel of this category Such a pity because everything else was great My advice to the management is more attention to details Having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board Not conductive to maintain grow the business Listen to your customers please ,0
200,No Negative,0
201, Taxi from hotel to airport was extortionate price so we took the train Breakfast was nice but very expensive ,0
202, Renovation around the hotel sometimes can start at 08 30 am and woke you up There is nothing inside the minibar but they charge deposit of 150 euros for nothing in the room They dont have a luggage room instead they have lockers but for this they charge deposit of 10 from you ,0
203, The room wasn t cleaned two days in a row I don t think glass wall and door to the bathroom is a good idea Didn t notice any navigation and got lost in hotel corridors for a few times ,0
204,No Negative,0
205, At first glance it looks like a dream hotel But then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance Importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order Even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom But at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room The doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room There really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors In addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you Clean room we had not exchanged towels for 3 days until we asked ,0
206, Would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on Bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with 4 hotel Having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room Having to ask for towels that were not left in the room Room 304 no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc ,0
207,No Negative,0
208, The only negative was the noise there were building works going on at the time which we were aware of when booking our stay and which weren t a huge problem but we did find it difficult to sleep with the noise at night cause by i assume the other guests It was probably enough to put me off visiting in the future ,0
209, Not given the room type we had booked and prepaid for No on site car park available despite pre booking of this Hotel was a building site so not very welcoming No privacy at all in bathroom as separated from lounge area by glass panel only Stairs to bed level steep and dangerous as no hand rail Arrived for our prepaid breakfast to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had ,0
210, next to a larger construction site shocking at first sight but not noisy or disturbing at least not during my stay,0
211,No Negative,0
212, Building work going on at the hotel didn t know this when we booked and didn t get a discount monday morning they started at 6 30am ,0
213, The room with stairs was quite uncomfortable with very reduced spaces and steep stairs ,0
214, The hotel is going though a period of renovation and extension Construction work starts at seven and is rather noisy Especially the entrance area is affected But the hotel does need a facelift ,0
215,No Negative,0
216, Its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking 30mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway This is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one Not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive Also I would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance No noise or dirt at all ,0
217, No convenient stores surrounding hotel area Had to walk quite far for grocery shopping,0
218, The pillow and the double charged city tax One of the staff at the reception is not so nice ,0
219, We don t like the open concept shower It gets very messy on the whole bathroom floor especially if you re not used to it Not a huge fan of the see through bathroom concept when you can see your friend using the toilet whilst watching television it is cool to watch tv while in the bath though The hotel room was otherwise very nice ,0
220,No Negative,0
221, Iron wasn t very good Bathroom is glass walls so you can see through it Building works took away from quality of hotel We didn t like they reserved 150 on our bank card which was not made clear prior to booking and we are still unsure of why this was done,0

232, floor tiles in bath room shower were slippery when wet Black coating on glass wall between bath bed room was obviously an attempt to darken the glass tint that was inadequate Hall way to rooms on 2nd floor was too dark gloomy Reception area stuffy too hot on day we checked in I question the 4 star rating,0
233, The bathroom needed to be deep cleaned Tiles had water marks no toiletries just champu and shower caps Loads of marks around the room of heavy use needs updating,0

239, Our room was above the bar area because the air conditioning was not working we had to have the windows wide open because it was hot so it was quite noisy late at night ,0
240, Rooms were not sufficiently cleaned on a daily basis i e no fresh cups provided once used toilet rolls not replaced bit embarrassing having to ask at reception for more ,0

411, The room for three people was on the small side ,0
412, Room wasn t ready on arrival after travelling from Leeds to London and phoning 2hours away to reserve parking Rude receptionist to girlfriend about parking as it wasn t our fault someone had taken our space We arrived at 16 00 and our room wasn t ready so was given a complimentary drink each and half an hour later still wasn t ready and being told it would be a further 40minutes Just wasn t good enough as we were only staying for 1 night and had a concert to go to ,0
413, Our room allocated wasn t up to our expectations bathroom was to small when you opened bathroom door you banged into the toilet We had to require a different room at an extra cost of 30 a night ,0
414, The cooked elements of breakfast could have been better but the continental selection was very good ,0
415, The room was a lot smaller than advertised I requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the 2nd floor They changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at 1am that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise Once reported to the front desk I was asked to move rooms at 1am No assistance was offered Second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much I thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced Beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable I didn t find the staff very friendly They weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe The gym is not worth calling a gym Has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv ,0
416, Lower ground floor room L01 possibly the smallest bathroom I ve ever stayed in awful View from Windows not inspiring to see the rat traps outside Won t go back ,0
417, Dimensions of the room small But I m was a single room and Erls court London The space cost money as a traditional London hotel,0

419,No Negative,0
420, Not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first We were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in Not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days And we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements It was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and B B in which we stayed on this three week UK vacation We would not recommend K K Hotel George nor would we return ourselves ,0
421, The hotel only support to call their contracted taxi which is expensive and unsafe when we paid by credit card they have no cashier mashine in the car instead they called the back office we had to tell them our credit card no expire month and the security no through the mobile phone this is very riskful for us The hotel should improve their taxi service raise the safety requirement to their contracted taxi company ,0
422, The front desk staff was not very informed regarding city happenings or tips Fortunately I could rely on the internet to answer more specific questions Additionally I was not entirely confident that they understood the questions I was asking in English ,0
423,No Negative,0
424,No Negative,0
425, Staff not very friendly Did their job but seldom smiled or made one feel welcomed ,0
426, Room size too small and it was too hot Our window was too small and It good lighting We stayed on the 4th floor and I believ that room should not be used but perhaps converted to a larger room or storage since the lighting was poor from this awkward size window Breakfast was ok but they started taking things away and cleaning while we were still there ,0
427, The room was a little stuffy They didn t have AC on yet Probably too early in the season Shower sometimes went hot and then cold ,0
428, The shower temperature was changing all the time from freezing to boiling and back ,0
429,No Negative,0
430, choice of food in bar wasn t too good but there are lots of great places to eat nearby so there was no problem ,0
431, The fact the windows don t open and the room was hot and stuffy and the bed was hard it was necessary to switch heating off put aircon on maximum and then of course it was noisy and even so there was no fresh air which is essential,0
432, The rooms are very small we had trouble fitting 2 suitcases in The price is fairly high even by London s standards and breakfast was extra ,0
433, The room is a little small and the decor is dated ,0
434, Air con seemed to be set on winter warmer but easily resolved switched it off and opened window simples ,0
435, We needed gluten free breakfast and ordered it beforehand but the serving was not safe The toasts were but nothing else not The table was set up in the way that cross contamination was difficult to avoid Also bacon eggs and potato cakes were cooked in the same oven and served together Potato cakes had gluten including flours They seemed to have no idea what exactly it all means to serve safe gluten free food ,0
436, breakfast the same everyday not much options but good and clean fitness center has one machine and they call fitness center small rooms ,0
437, Breakfast was crowded at times and the selection of food was ok but not great ,0
438, Rooms could be updated that being said everything is functional and very clean ,0
439, Bed was too soft bathroom a wee bit small for manoeuvring in ,0
440, The wifi is only 500kb s which isn t fast by today s standards The power socket near the bed was loosen I can t charge my phone ,0
441,No Negative,0
442, We were put in a basement room which certainly wouldn t have classed as a 4 star room How ever it was clean and bed was comfortable ,0
443, Wifi is ridiculously slow and fiddly to connect using Chrome Breakfast coffee was only average,0
444, We choose to personally take our laundry to be cleaned as it was 1 10 th of the cost of what the hotel was going to charge this was very excessive The room was very warm but we managed by keeping the windows and drapes open ,0
445, Not convinced that solo travellers are treated with the same consideration as others for room location in the hotel in particular,0
446, Top floor rooms were so small had to leave one suitcase in the car as unable to fit it in Rooms very hot and had to have windows open in sub zero temperatures Shower over bath tub was dangerously erratic with cold water rapidly displaced by scalding water and no non slip mat or stickers in bath Lethal combination for the elderly or children Second room key not allowed by the hotel s security so had to call reception to let us in if separated Front desk staff very dismissive ,0
447, The breakfast staff were not helpful When we went for breakfast the restaurant was busy and we were asked to wait about 5 minutes to be seated They forgot about us and we had to approach them about our table After 25 minutes we were finally seated I was so upset I did not have a breakfast and left the restaurant in disgust at our treatment We won t be back,0

450,No Negative,0
451, Breakfast is expensive especially when I have already paid over 90 for a standard room per night ,0
452, mistake over payments and noise due to creaky floorbords Also It would ve been nice if we were told beforehand that a 60 euros deposit would be required regarding potential mini bar consumptions When we refused to comply the person in charge told us curtly that our mini bar shall be emptied fothwith ,0
453, The only thing I can think of is that i would have preferred not to have a wall to wall carpet in the room but it seemed clean so it was no big deal ,0
454,No Negative,0
455,No Negative,0
456, I had to ask at breakfast all 3 mornings we were there for coffee and re fills I think it would be better to have coffee on the buffet as you could just help yourself like you could with tea,0
457, My one complaint is the overly soft mattresses It was not good for my back ,0
458, The mattress wasn t comfortable and the pillows were way too soft I had a neck ache the next morning The room was super tiny We stayed at the Hilton Bankside and the room was so spacious in comparison ,0
459, Temperature in the room was difficult to regulate ,0
460, I don t know if it was because I booked through Booking com but seemed to get the worst room in the place Underground with no view Unable to book breakfast for second day at the reduced price as I should have done it on check in I didn t know what I was going to be doing on check in Tea and biscuits not replenished the second day ,0
461, Really nothing this was a perfect choice ,0
462, Rooms are not heated may be an issue in very cold winters Gym is open from 4 00 pm to 10 00pm when you usually are out ,0
463, Soiled chair in room Pillows not clean Shower temp control very sensitive in 1st room we stayed in Value for money,0
464,No Negative,0
465, We asked for 2 singles and a sofa bed but were given a double bed and no explanation There were few accessible plugs for hair straighteners and the like and the hair dryer didn t work To be fair we didn t take this up with the hotel so they may have sorted this if asked to do so ,0
466, No Iron and ironing board and maybe a few sachets of hot chocolate in the room nothing really to complain about ,0
467, Did book a twin bedded room and got a very large double so it didn t matter too much Loo very low lucky I am only 5ft 2 ,0
468, Staff not particularly helpful Have stayrf before and not had room serviced so had to request this 3 times Breakfasy ok but not outstanding for a 4 Rooms small esp bathroom and not particularly warm,0
469, Housekeeping missed my room one day and although I did not make much of a fuss over it I did not get a convincing explanation I did get an apology though ,0
470, room wasn t ready was upgraded but had to pay for a drink while we waited,0
471, bathroom is really small,0
472, Staff could ve been a bit more clued up failed to check my booking room assigned was not what I asked for I requested a double and on entering the room was given a twin So was offered a double in the lower ground it didn t smell very pleasant in the room and the mattresses need to be changed I was advised I had been upgraded This was probably due to the error made on check in however even though the room may have been bigger there were no extras in the room and the TV was much smaller Clearly not an upgrade I don t know I guess for 135 I was expecting a lot more for a 1 night stay On checking in I was asked to pay for breakfast as its more expensive on the day yet it was already part of the rate I didn t have the best start to staying here unfortunately And not even a helping hand with my bag considering the error of assigning me the wrong room laid with the hotel breakfast could ve been more fresh and hotter Appreciate I had arrived 25mins before it closed yet it was still in the valid timeset ,0
473, Weird atmosphere in reception many eastern European staff Room Cold and uninspiring 4 per drink of cheap orange juice mixed with tap water Overpriced overall,0
474, Front desk night manager charged my bill in dollars without permission He tried to net an extra 40 on my bill with the horrible exchange rate When I caught it he told me I must have authorized it at check in which I had not Completely unacceptable ,0
475, The towel in the bathroom had blood on it and it wasn t our blood so disgusting Also we had a room below the pavement at the front of the hotel with a lot of noise from foot traffic and their conversations ,0
476, The gym facility is pointless make sure you go elsewhere if you want to use the gym ,0
477, Two years in a row we checked in for 10 days On booking we were asked about early arrival and we noted we would arrive before the 3pm check in time No effort was made to shorten or minimize hours of waiting time to get our room Last year our friends from the Midlands arrived for a 1 night stay while we were there and at 9am sharp their room was ready and they got in Let me see ten days and thousands of pound versus one night Who do you take care of ,0
478, Saw into the cleaner maids cupboard due to a door not fully shut during hours when servicing of rooms was not happening,0
479, The air condition did not work for cooling down the room we were told to shut it off and open the windows which brought all sounds from streets in from police etc Our room on the 5th floor was small and the bathroom was very small about 3 m2 ,0
480, The bathroom is too small and the break fast lacks variety for one staying more than four days I stayed for 6 nights The cleaners don t replenish toiletry supplies facial tissues ran out from my rom and they didn t refinish them They also don t replace bed covers if you don t ask them,0
481, It was noisy throughout the night because of the central heating boiler being so close to room 116 If it wasn t the boiler it was something else noisy ,0
482, The heating was not working in the room for the first two days,0
483, I think this may be a London thing judging from other reviews but the rooms and corridors are tiny think small and take away another foot In our room the window didn t close properly the heat didn t work and the bath did not empty when you took a shower Very dated apart from the TV If like us you intend not to be in your room much the hotel is adequate but would I stay again not if it was free is the answer,0
484, Noise from other rooms eg talking late at night airless corridors smelled a bit institutional,0
485, The room facing the street sometimes there s some noise from people chat but it became silence after midnight ,0
486, I can t think of a thing that needed improved upon All aspects of my stay were excellent ,0
487, Definitely not a 4 star hotel Triple room was super tiny not even a double room size we were really struggling Not enough wardrobe space not enough plugs in the room third bed very umcomfortable Facilities very basic toileteries including only shampoo and shower gel very bad quality not even shower cap or body lotion Except for the reception ladies staff very rude Definitely not reccomended Being in London in the same area several times and there are definitely better real 4 stars ,0
488,No Negative,0
489, Cleaning of the hotel is a bit slow room does not get cleaned until 5pm For people who like to take some rest in the hotel during the day seems to be inconvenient ,0
490, Very small room dated interior The cleaning could improve My room floor had an angle from one side of the wall towards the bed The bed was loosing boards underneath it ,0
491, Maybe bathroom door could open out vs in as it s a very tight space and this would help ,0
492, There is no proper air conditioning it s set to heating in October so the room can get too hot to have a comfortable temperature to sleep Air con at this time of the year is opening the windows ,0
493, We only stayed 2 nights ,0
494,No Negative,0
495, There was nothing that we can think of The room key is very large and there is only one They ask that you turn it in when you go out It s a little eccentric but OK ,0
496, there where waterpipes near the room it sounded like it s in our own toilet everytime someone upstairs flushed very loud and sbsolutely disturbing maybe only in these room 12 ,0
497, The room was really really cold The heating didn t work I was brought an electric heater but the room was too cold for it to make any difference This led to a really bad nights sleep ,0
498,No Negative,0
499, Thankfully upgraded to a superior room and even that was small and noisy No scrambled eggs at breakfast first morning second morning they ran out of eggs Should be constantly monitored This is a deceptively large and busy hotel I requested somewhere within close walking distance to Olympia 25 min walk is not that close ,0
500, The bed mattress was too hard without the mattress topper on which we removed because it made us hot The mattress was orthopaedic firm,0
501, Breakfast is good but has some potential for improvements Long periods without eggs etc Very limited selection of vegetables and salad Would probably expect better breakfast from a 4 star place ,0
502, Don t believe there was anything we didn t like My personal choice for marmalade at breakfast wasn t available but I was able to find something else amongst the spread choices to satisfy my palate so this isn t a complaint ,0
503, Personally I think the bathroom needs a door to keep water away from the toilet and it will save the clerk a lot of cleaning work by putting a plastic bag in the rubbish bin ,0
504, Just walking in the reception could be made a bit more comfortable perhaps seating for more than 1 person a table for brochures Also we found that the area had many good local restaurants which could be printed on a simple map as well as grocery stores hairdresser etc These were in walking distance to the hotel and would be a great help for first time visitors ,0
505,No Negative,0
506, Nothing could have been better honestly and I m very critical and picky ,0
507,No Negative,0
508,No Negative,0
509, It took them 3 days to charge our card minutes before the client arrived inconvenient and stressful to deal with i had to repeat the story to 3 different staff poor english from staff we cant book for our employees there again,0
510, The breakfast was expensive and not what every traveler would want early in the morning It would have been nice if coffee was offered in the bar for people that werent dining We would have been happy to pay for it too Instead we had to walk a block every morning to get take out coffee so we could drink it while we all showered for the day We noticed many guests doing the same ,0
511, Why carp when there is nothing to carp about ,0
512, The official price is a bit high unless you can take advantage of a good offer like I did ,0
513, The room temp was a little warm and the windows didn t really open It was very hot in London while I was there so it wasn t really under their control,0
514, The ATM machine malfunctioned and a more timely out of service notice would have eliminated some stress ,0
515, The bathroom was cramped It was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily The shower spilled water out all over the floor There was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it Water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction The breakfast was very disappointing It was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar We had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well I also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked The bacon was quite watery The selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better ,0
516, Air conditioning didn t cope with the really hot weather but luckily had big windows we could open to cool the room down at night ,0
517, Bed sheets pillows and carpet could be cleaner bugs ,0
518, Nothing really A lower price is always good of course ,0
519, WiFi was a bit slow ,0
520, Housekeeping staff were rude shower had water pressure and temperature problems and the hotel has double charged me and has yet to solve the issue ,0
521, Ex Suite was extremely small smaller then our yacht cabin the week before The temperature of the room could not be lower than 18 degrees which wasn t cool enough ,0
522, The bathroom is on the smaller side ,0
523, the room was a little small and the shower ran hot and cold ,0
524, Room was small but adequate There was old toothpaste under a rim of the washbasin which was never reached by the cleaner even though I put some paper on it to indicate its existence Fire alarm went off at 2 am and we were all in the street for a while All was eventually sorted but no general instructions or explanation ,0
525, Fire alarm and semi evacuation at 2 am little or no direction by staff Reason for alarm a guest had caused an electrical short was announced by Fire officer for benefit of those near enough to hear No subsequent acknowledgement or customer relations gesture by hotel e g perhaps a small discount on checkout other than being told somewhat curtly that it wasn t the fault of the hotel Some guests noticed from the street that a number of bedrooms had remained occupied throughout the incident ,0
526, The room it was fairly small It wasn t a problem for us as we spent very little time in the room but it was rather compact and may be a problem for those who need to use the room longer than we did ,0
527, Room was a little on the small side but that is to be expected in central London Shower temp was very dodgy but not a major issue either ,0
528, Nothing really ,0
529, Our room had a very pungent smell of tobacco smoke The blackout blind didn t work very well ,0
530, Nothing,0
531, Air conditioning a little noisy we opened the window instead,0
532, They weren t inexpensive ,0
533, Farthest room from elevator Uncomfortable bed Air conditioning would not set to our temperature therefore far too hot in room Staff were not interested when told about it We did not sleep well because of it ,0
534, Room needed to be redecorated as it was a little worn looking,0
535,No Negative,0
536, Cost of the executive double room same as our usual classic double room clearly dishonest Shower bathroom in executive older and not as helpful as the walk in shower in classic Air con did not work So called mini bar is not a mini bar but a bare fridge We have been here many times but the added cost over 100 a night for fewer facilities amenities has upset us a great deal ,0
537, Room was really tiny and I don t think was good value for money but I would definitely stay again in upgraded room as this is a fantastic hotel,0
538, Tea and coffee facilities in the rooms need updating and improving The old fashioned kettle and a hand full of tea bags and instant coffee sachets might have been okay in the early 90 s but not anymore And would it really be too much to ask for a bottle of water or two in a 200 per night room Instead of draining the tap dry in search of something other than tepid water from the bathroom sink ,0
539, Small room Some staff weren t very knowledgeable about the area and transportation options ,0
540,No Negative,0
541, Wifi is so weak and slow at night heating is weak although it is coming from a controllable central air conditioning bath is a bit small hotel overall is a bit dated breakfast is expensive,0
542, Not keen on the steps up to the front door is there an alternative entrance for mobility impaired ,0
543,No Negative,0
544, Rigid rules Our plane arrives in the morning so I requested early check in in the booking Acknowledgement for the request was sent by booking com but no reply or notice from the hotel We arrived and was greeted by a male tall staff with a stern face and harsh tone I started with good morning I know it s too early but I wonder if you ve got a room for us I booked 2 rooms but was just hoping just to get a room first as my father is disabled and he wetted his pants on the way to airport He replied without even looking at me room is guaranteed at 3pm Leave you baggage over there He then started tossing a baggage tag to me and several more The tags are in pairs 1 to tie on the bag and one for us to keep he untied the first pair and literally tossed the remaining 4 pairs to me as I realised it was self service I did the 5 bags by myself and before I could finish he already rushed me to take my tags I can t believe he could be so rude We brought my father downstairs to the loo and got him changed and went out We were so very exhausted and we couldn t help return to the hotel at around 12nn By then we were offered 1 room I saw the lady pulling the file from a stack and I am not sure if there actually were other rooms available already I let my parents in the room and it was soooo very small even by london s standard My bf and I waited at the lobby when we were being stared by the staff like we offended them We waited till 3pm to get our room and of course our room is not next to my parents even though I requested for it when I made the booking and no reply as well And during the check in I had to fill in exactly the same form again with the same info I have absolutely no idea why when the whole booking was made by me myself I understand that they were only following procedures but all these were just very inhuman and inflexible that exhausted guests in every way ,0
545, Took several days to fix a broken window curtain so woken very early in the morning by sunlight Temperature fluctuations in the shower from scalding hot to cold was annoying ,0
546, Not much room in bathroom and room was basic for the price paid Aside from that the hotel was lovely ,0
547, Its a hit and miss with the reception staff Sometimes I got lucky with someone who s friendly and provided excellent customer service but sometimes some of them were too green and not that trained The restaurant got very busy during breakfast time so the staff could get unfriendly ,0
548, The double room we stopped in was a little small but was adequate ,0
549,No Negative,0
550, Occasional quirky sound from the floor next door or 1 floor above quite disturbing Expensive ,0
551, the size of the room is small for Americans but pretty standard for Europe ,0
552, Let me think about it Nothing really ,0
553, The restaurant changed as we were about to leave and the new menu didn t look very appealing,0
554, I can t think of a single thing ,0
555, Having stayed here a few times before I thought I would have a pleasant stay as usual I was wrong For a business traveller small things like toiletry and wifi go a long way Those used to be good in this hotel Not when I visited this time I ll look for somewhere else for my next trip ,0
556, The toilet was too low to the floor The room was much too hot and the Windows did not open ,0
557, There was nothing in the mini fridge It was empty I would have liked to have had the option of drinking eating something later in the evening before going to bed without having to call room service ,0
558, The toilet is slightly small though it contains everything The floor is wooden so you could hear people walking It will be noisy for people with difficulty of falling asleep But for travellers just coming to London this does not count ,0
559, The rooms were extremely small I don t think the breakfast was good value for money,0
560,No Negative,0
561, The room was too hot needed a fan over night to cool down no opening windows,0

565, No water to drink in spa area Room on small side compared to advertised twin room Kettle plug dangling not obvious where to plug in ,0
566,No Negative,0
567, Breakfast used to include a better selection ie smoked salmon more fruit selection champagne Now more English breakfast which means the cost is pricey at 15 pounds Wait staff not very friendly had to ask for coffee after they passed my table several times ,0
568, The bathrooms are tiny but do work in as much as the showers are good but unless your very small it s impossible to dry oneself other than in the bedroom There is a lack Of plug sockets in the bedrooms and the bar area is soulless ,0
569, No negatives ,0
570, Rooms are small and would have preferred one overlooking the garden instead we were over the front door and the flag pole was noisy ,0
571, My room on the fourth floor had only narrow windows at the top of the wall and those were partly blocked by the roof decorations so the room had a boxy closed in feeling ,0
572, the bathrooms ar very small BUT everything you need is there They were also spotless,0
573, Serving of coffee for breakfast had logistics problems Please give people a tip that they can ask for a pot to be filled with coffee to be able to serve themselves at acceptable frequencies Now for every cup we were dependent on staff not always available and not always 100 coffee focussed noticing our lack of java and distributing one cup at a time ,0

587, Cooked breakfast not very imaginative Too small plates Can t cook eggs Room not as big as I hoped for in exec room king size bed,0
588, The room is too warm cooling is not in use duting the heating season The hotel still uses its famous breakfast in marketing That is almost a fraud The breakfast is not nearly what it used to be It was okay but not a reason to come any more The location still is a reason ,0
589, Room was too hot the windows do open but there were noisy revellers so we had to close the windows ,0
590, Nothing at all,0
591, the sofa in the room was quite uncomfortable leaving me with a aching back ,0
592, The bathroom is quite small but did have a tub,0
593, Wifi does not work in the room its a shame for a big business city like london in 2016 to dont provide proper wifi Had to work from the toilet where the signal was here,0
594, The only bad thing I can tell about teh hotel is that the room was just a little bit small Not much space to move ,0
595, Room was cold the warm air heating struggled to keep up with a very cold spell in London and the thermostat controls are impossible to understand The hotel clearly has problems getting cleaning staff to work on Saturday Our room was not ready on time Having said that the staff were quick to find an alternative room albeit a cold one ,0
596, Double glazing windows would have kept cold and noise outside But then this is a London old hotel ,0
597, Insufficient UK power points for a couple on business without requesting UK adaptors Breakfast reasonable choice but a number of items were cool instead of hot Gym could do with an update Room was a little too compact ,0
598, Dated rooms rooms stated bath and shower but did not have both a dated hotel on rooms but bar was trendy setting Reception staff do not care when you have booked as you are captive there ,0
599,No Negative,0
600, Very definitely the breakfast Fruit selection limited Very little input from staff Many 4 star hotels will bring coffee or tea to your table The fried eggs were dry and inedible They clearly had been there too long and had not been replenished The outlook on to the garden was lovely ,0
601, The room for 3 person are not very big And another very bad surprise is with Booking Hotel i Made a reservation with a breakfast but when i arrived at hotel the breakfast didn t inclused,0
602, Bathrrom quite cramped breakfast was ok but not outstanding more fruit ,0
603,No Negative,0
604, My only thing I would say was the food during the evening and this is only because the choices were very limited I am a fussy eater and couldn t see anything I liked however the breakfast was lovely,0
605, The sauna facilities were located in the same room as the massage tables and exercise bikes a little compact and restrictive with no changing facilities ,0
606, nothing,0
607, Thin wall can hear everything on the hallway I would definitely avoid rooms right next to or across from the elevators as you really can hear people passing by ,0
608, Worst nights sleep in a long long time Pillows were awful gave me a bad neck Couldn t turn the heating off I barely slept due to how hot it was Bathroom was absolutely stifling ,0
609, First night s stay was very hot because air conditioning had been turned off throughout the hotel Requested a fan for our room but did not receive one ,0
610, Front of room breakfast staff woman was very rude to us The scrambled eggs did not taste good at all Very buttery and watery ,0
611, Nothing could have been better This is one of if not the best hotels I ve stayed in for it s attention to detail ,0
612,No Negative,0
613, A little cold in the room and what seemed an older heating system needed to be switched on to warm the room up not as welcoming to the room when it feels cold as you go in ,0
614, Rooms to small smell coming from shower drain sugar not replenish after first night constant noise from other ac units by the time you got hot breakfast it was cold,0
615, Room was too hot even with air con on full and heating right down ,0
616,No Negative,0
617, Bed in room 110 was appalling and needs replacement To compound this the staff were aware of the problem which means I was not the first to complain ,0
618, old building re furnished sound travelled from top floor down bathroom very small,0
619, very thin walls terrible nights sleep doors banging and water running no help with luggage offered dining room for breakfast far too warm for comfort reception staff in morning not offered to get taxi until i asked specifically to order write up on booking com implied 350 yards to Olympia it was not,0
620, Bed is too hard pillows were horrible AC didn t work well and was extremely hot even though it was at its maximum and slow wifi Wouldn t recommend it at all,0
621, The bathroom was far too small for an executive room The key of my room did not work properly ,0
622, breakfast times could start earlier Mon Friday to allow for the travel time to get in to the city centre for work Room upgrades are not promoted at the reception or when booking in by hotel staff Wi Fi speed extremely slow The bar prices need to be more in line with the high street prices to attract more guest 5 00 for a pint of Larger is a little extreme ,0
623, New management means the small luxuries that made this hotel very special have disappeared it will surely not retain its 9 rating for long,0
624, Didn t realise we had to book car parking due to limited spaces available We were lucky to have a space will book in future ,0
625, nothing,0
626,No Negative,0
627, Unfortunately there was a constant tapping noise in the room coming from within the bathroom The hairdryer did not work and only found out the morning I was checking out and didn t have time to do anything about it ,0
628, Lower ground floor room basement basically next to offices and directly opposite service lift which meant a lot of passing noise Window was a view of a stairway fire escape so lacked privacy with curtains open ,0
629, The hotel is nice but the facilities are poor the bed felt like IKEA The gym was a joke the hotel bar didn t know how to make simple cocktails,0
630, The room was too hot despite the fact we turned down the thermostat ,0
631, Rooms could have been a bit bigger Design and decor dated ,0
632, nothing,0
633,No Negative,0
634, Nothing really important,0
635,No Negative,0
636, Room was tiny and was literally next to a lift built behind the cupboards You can hear it clearly every time someone uses it Definitely ask for a room away from one There is a very annoying and fairly loud noise that randomly kicks in any time of the day Guess its the air conditioning but frustrating when you already have the lift making noises from your cupboard The pillows are far too soft your head sinks in and its not comfortable ,0
637,No Negative,0
638, a bit petty but important extra socket near the bed for charging the phone computer there was only one for the night light ,0
639, This was my sixth visit in K K hotel George I brought this time my whole family with me and had told everybody there would be sparkling wine at the breakfast There was not sparkling wine anymore wich made us unhappy ,0
640,No Negative,0
641, The room was small and very warm even with air conditioning It was situated beside the lift even though I requested a quiet room The bathroom was even smaller ,0
642, Room a little on the small side though perfect for one person Food in room service could have been a little more interesting Good coffee though ,0
643, room was adjacent to staircase on 4th fnloor Sounded like staff used them in he early hours pre breakfast ,0
644, Small rooms ,0
645, English breakfast was not too good and a little cold However they do cater for lots of different nationalities not just the English and there was plenty of choice ,0
646, The room little bit small But for couple is enough in London you spend most of the time outside the hotel so it s ok There is no air condition in the room or it was not working It was very warm in the room we opened the window to get some cold air in January ,0
647, Bathroom toilet was very small which is fairly usual for London hotels ,0
648,No Negative,0
649, I filled in the request form to reserve a parking place although the site says reservation is not needed On arrival no reserved parking place because I only made a request Lousy no wifi on 5th floor no cleaning of room after complaining they told us the maid had gone home ,0
650, Smallish room water pressure in the shower could have been better,0
651, Prior to booking this hotel we assumed you had disabled facilities but when we arrived there was no disabled facilities which made our stay very uncomfortable we will not be staying again ,0
652, The standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room We really appreciated that because we were going to spend 6 days in that hotel But even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all London hotels The room did not have central heating It was December and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold When we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold As in all London central hotels this hotel is also not value for money If it were say in Munich or Milan it definitely would be half this price ,0
653, Only one luft was in operation during peak season Single room was quite small Double rooms looked larger ,0
654, See above tangent ,0
655, I booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night The booking was made within 24 hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed When I arrived they insisted I pay for the canceled booking I should have just walked away but thought I could resolve it They were rude and steadfast in insisting I pay for the canceled night I contacted Booking com to help resolve the situation Booking com were very helpful recognized I had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue The hotel blankly refused Not very nice people at all I would never stay again ,0
656, We were promised the same room we had We left for six days and when we came back they offered us a room off the lobby by the elevator There was no division between the double bed and the single bed I had to insist they give us another room The manager did not want to go out of her way even though I insisted I finally said I would write a letter She gave us a double and single on a higher floor ,0
657, Breakfast not the best of choices and although we were still in good time it was barely warm felt like leftovers,0
658, in spite of the environmental friendly policy our towels were exchanged on the 2nd day although we had not dropped them on the floor which is an unnecessary waste of resources,0
659, It was kind of far from typical tourist attractions although most of them were within the reach of a single tube ride ,0
660, 1 Didn t feel that the executive room was anything amazing bathrobes and a larger bed but room generally small we were in 307 2 Had to queue for breakfast both mornings could you not provide tea coffee for those who have to wait we waited 15 minutes 3 Too warm ,0
661,No Negative,0
662, On my previous visit I had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel When I arrived there was a denial that I had made a booking This was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom I had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the 16th Dec 2 days after my original stay However my booking had been made with booking com on the 6th Dec so one way or another someone cocked up but I was blamed for the failure in their communication Poor show ,0
663,No Negative,0
664, The website is misleading the property looks a little tired and feels claustrophobic The parking charges on the full website were higher than on the mobile website which demonstrates a lack of attention to detail The bathroom was tiny ,0
665, Room was small bathroom very small Breakfast room too small people had to queue every morning Coffee and tea not up to standard Breakfast buffet was good ,0
666, Base in the shower was a bit slippery and stained ,0
667, Parking required a degree in physics to accomplish as the spaces are tight but better than nothing u guess,0
668, Having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the room was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them Having paid for an executive room expected executive service as was told no tables for available for breakfast They told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for 2 not 6 They know which rooms are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot breakfast On the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station We were told 25 minutes to Liverpool Street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it We had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day The fare quoted was 26 we were charged 30 and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in 25 minutes I have emailed the hotel manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply Very disappointed overall ,0
669, Attic room with windows so high up we couldn t see out Bathroom although clean was dated a bit 1990s and mixer tap didn t work on shower so water was either scalding or tepid I didn t realise this still happened in London ,0
670, The hotel arranged for a taxi to take us to the station at a fixed price of 25 00 it was a private firm and not a London black cab Although the driver was very pleasant and got us to the station on time the car itself absolutely stank of cigarette smoke Not pleasant ,0
671, One of the staff at reception in the evening apparently has some issues as he was very rude to my wife The rest of the staff were pleasant and helpful ,0
672, We had no ventilation in bathroom,0
673, The beds Quite small room We asked if there were complimentary coffee somewhere but were not informed that we had it in the room It was hidden in the cupboard ,0
674, Nothing ,0
675, we had a bit of a hiccup the room we were given first as we opened the door the smell of smoke was very bad they moved us to a other room which was lovely,0
676, Small rooms but very tidy Room insolation not perfect we could hear people from the room next to ours ,0
677, Room and bathroom were far too hot even with both bedroom windows open it was too hot,0
678, Nothing It s perfect ,0
679, The first room with a king size bed we got had incredibly loud floorboards and no bath we then switched rooms to a twin suite which was much more satisfactory The view many had complimented was rather underwhelming and this from the fifth floor ,0
680, It s a hotel needs little updating Continental breakfast buffet was ok hot entrees sometimes only warm often selections were gone faster than the help could replace printer to computer was inoperable the 4 days we stayed Room wi fi was so so,0
681, No bad experiences at all,0
682,No Negative,0
683, Very expensive would not have stayed except meeting US family at same hotel I trod on sharp debris initially thought it was glass turned out to be shards of plastic probably from a pen on my room carpet which I stood on as I got into bed Staff brought a hoover up to clean but we found more in the morning Shows room had not been properly cleaned Unable to open window as it was stiff and too high up tried standing on a chair Room was tiny and not good value for money ,0
684, Parking was an issue and we had to spend time asking around other hotels for a space Breakfast quite comprehensive get in quick or you ll miss out on some items Breakfast tea was not a brand to savour Left it after a sip Some guests had also left items uncovered e g Cheese selection and flies were enjoying these There was a timid fox in the garden Although it was lovely to see with small children in particular it is a risk Mobile coverage seemed to be poor and Wifi alleviated issues to some extent ,0

970,No Negative,0
971, Difficult to locate the phone to contact reception lack toilet itineraries and it was difficult to locate these ,0
972, Air con not great ,0
973, Not a fan of the breakfast to be honest the eggs were quite watery Also we did not buy breakfast in advance which was good because when you arrive they give you a 25 off voucher I would have been very annoyed if I had paid full price in advance and the person next to me got a better deal ,0
974, No parking on site We parked about 1 2 mile away but it s expensive Parking from 15 30 Friday until 11 30am Sunday cost 42 00 Although reasonable by London standards it s an added expense for a weekend away Perhaps the hotel could workout a concession with local car parks Restaurant expensive given the quality of food ,0
975,No Negative,0
976, We have been charged for room service that we did not have I spoke to the hotel yesterday who said they would remove the charge of 43 53 issue and amended invoice and email to confirm that the charge had been removed This has not been done ,0
977, It would be helpful if the hotel could provide more detailed info on how to get to the hotel from the subway station Customers shld look out for the green elephant in the doorway otherwise really difficult to find the entrance to the hotel ,0
978, Every thing was excellent Apart from room service for food that never came and been woken up at 9 am by staff walking in room When I mentioned in to reception when checking out they didn t seam bothered ,0
979, No problems at all ,0
980,No Negative,0
981,No Negative,0
982, Not a lot to put in this section If I was going to be very picky I d say the food menu was average but still very palatable i e not bad Wine list could be improved ,0
983, Meals very plain No extras or garnishes Restaurant staff didn t seem very knowledgeable Cold croissants for breakfast ,0
984, No toothbrush provided,0
985, Nothing,0
986, The shower flooded the bathroom and hallway as there was no seal on the shower door and the plugs in bath and sink were no draining sue to clogged hair when we booked via booking com it initially said breakfast included however it was no and actually ended up costing an extra 40 pounds for two people breakfast was minimal consisting of one sausage a spoonful of beans and 1 bacon and tomato and small black pudding was not much of a selection of cheese etc just a couple of bits that had been out a while ,0
987, The Wi Fi was rather terrible My husband was able to get it to work on his phone but it did not work on mine And since I did not get an international plan for my phone for this trip I was relying on Wi Fi to communicate while in London Thankfully there were other locations around the city where I could connect to the Wi Fi ,0
988, The only thing I d fault was that the pillows were very thick and no options for thinner or different pillows ,0
989, They don t have parking and there is no easy parking available nearby ,0
990, The staff is quite annoying and could be more discreet entering the room without invitation The view from the hotel was quite uninspiring ,0
991,No Negative,0
992, Breakfast buffet continental was ok but nothing out of the ordinary A la carte was also possible but we didn t try ,0
993, More seating in the bar area would be good also it s a trek to use the toilets ,0
994,No Negative,0
995,No Negative,0
996, The cleaner knocked on our door at 8am which wasn t ideal We were checking out that day so no need to clean the room Being fussy the dressing gown and towels weren t hugely soft ,0
997, This was my second time at this hotel the first time I booked the basic room and was pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room I was given This time I opted to upgrade to a more expensive room and was surprised that it was much smaller than the room I had stayed in before It just might be that I was given a free upgrade the first time ,0
998, Going as a family with two rooms hired in the same reservation they allocated us in two different buildings They were even unable to allocate us in different floors of the same building,0
999, Some of the complimentary items of food from the room were missing and there was an empty box in the minibar too ,0
1000, A few more little milks maybe as I drink a lot of tea but I was given a little jug of milk when I asked ,0
1001, The air conditioning rattled all night and was rather noisy the room was a lot smaller than previous trips but just as expensive A lot better value for money in other hotels ,0
1002, Nothing your doing a fantastic job,0
1003, The rooms were too dark and warm After shaving I got on a plane and realized I missed half my face The bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting Another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet The bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room It was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room The walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories One should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast The staff were from anywhere else but Britain which did not help make our British experience any better ,0
1004, If we had to pick one thing it would be the pillows are a bit to soft but everyone is different Literally could not find fault with anything ,0
1005, Location was fine for where I needed to be but if you could find find yourself a little aways from the center and Covent Garden Depends what you looking for underground is about 10 mins walk in either direction ,0
1006, At the outside front entrance to the hotel there is a large carpeted area that was extremely wet due to the weather which spoiled the lovely entrance to an otherwise great hotel ,0
1007, We felt the price of breakfast is just too much and would have added another 100 to price of our stay ,0
1008, The room looked straight onto an office window so was a little obtrusive But understand I wasn t paying for a view ,0
1009, Bath tub was good but if once water falles out there s no pipe to get lid of them ,0
1010, Not quite the top notch quality it was a couple of years ago Although still a very good hotel the age is slowly starting to show Carpet coming loose in the hallway wall sockets not EU compatible small things like the bottle opener in the room broken and the nice little Bose speaker have the old iPhone 4 connector ,0
1011,No Negative,0
1012, Breakfast is good but quite expensive particularly if you compare it to prices of breakfast to go on Fleet Street ,0
1013, Service Also they would have given reductions or breakfast in the price but could not because we booked through you Had my 60th birthday while staying The hotel knew this and made no acknowledgement of this not even an extra packet of biscuits Spent two thousand pounds on 3 rooms Felt short changed ,0
1014, My son and his family were staying the same two nights in identical rooms He booked directly with Apex and got full breakfasts included for the same room price that I paid Booking via booking com cost me almost an extra 50 for breakfasts even after I had negotiated a bit of a discount by reference to the comparison ,0
1015, Everything was genuinely perfect ,0
1016, Nothing Our second stay at this hotel and the hotel is very much in our Green Band as experienced and discerning hotel visitors,0
1017, Bose sound system was not blue tooth and still on iPhone 4 adapter Advertised sky movies but was pin protected but I m sure we could have contacted reception to gain the code ,0
1018, It took a little longer than expected for for the room service to be cleared from outside our room But that is being ultra fussy as it wasnt left inside the room ,0
1019, its just really really cheap furnished no seating possibility except ONE office chair in the room nothing comfortable it is MINIMalistic furnished which would be ok in a way but you just don t feel home there Glad I just booked it for one night to try a new place since I am frequently traveling to London and was searching for a place closer to our office in Fleetstreet,0
1020, The breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at It would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works Our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the Continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway It caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided Make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers The food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this ,0
1021,No Negative,0
1022, Service at the bar we had to wait quite long to get served even tough there were only a few other guests at the bar Variety of the buffet was a little poor for a continental breakfast ,0
1023,No Negative,0
1024, A couple of times the staff missed to replace the shampoo bottles but we are all humans ,0
1025, Room on small side for a King very expensive for the Wednesday Thursday nights First night pillows like rocks requested change and got one soft and one slab Third night managed to find 2 soft pillows Bed comfortable Not enough hangers in cupboards for 2 people staying more than 1 night Room temperature control did not go lower than 19C and seemed to revert to 25C once room key taken out Bar prices on the high side ,0
1026, Lowered check in desk for shorter or disabled Jellybeans and Pringles missing Only one duck 2people Automatic doors for people with mobility issues and wheelchair users Didn t get the room I booked ,0
1027, The ends of the bath were very vertical it looked pretty but not the most comfortable for a relaxing soak after a long day but I am aware I m fussy with my baths ,0
1028,No Negative,0
1029, A bit mean with tea coffee milk in room ,0
1030, Tray charge too expensive putting us off ordering food smart tv did not seem to work well but none of these issues detracted from a comfortable and enjoyable stay ,0
1031, We got a room 542 with a very disappointing view we were looking right into the balconies of other rooms the room itself did not have a balcony Especially in summer you won t have much privacy Location Temple is very central but still I would chose another central location the next time I m in London as in the weekends Temple seems a bit deserted ,0
1032, 1 The hair dryer can not be used in the bathroom and that I can understand But then the plug in the room should be closer to the Mirror or at least to have a larger hair dryer electric cord Because I could not see myself in the Mirror whilst I was drying my hair So basically the hotel has have 3 options Larger hair dryer electric cord Electric plug closer to the mirror Mirror on both sides of the TV 2 Another small comment the shower mat had dessapeared the second night I guess by mistake it was removed and not replaced ,0
1033, Can t think of anything that could have been improved ,0
1034, The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night which was a bit disorientating Pretty sure this isn t regular but there you go ,0
1035, Sorry can t think of any negative thing ,0
1036, How hasn t this place got a extra star It should be five star not four ,0
1037, Really we could find fault with nothing ,0
1038, The basin doesn t seem to be clean enough It s difficult to drain waters down the basin,0
1039, The shower was half clean the window curtain and the window were dirty ,0
1040, Could have had a few more different tea bags in room ,0
1041, As always the price of breakfast is far too expensive There are several places nearby to eat at sensible prices ,0
1042, We heard our neighbors bathroom in the night,0
1043, Just loved it ,0
1044, IN the early morning my sleep was interrupted by the buzzer from the speaker on the desk I didn t know what happened The air conditioning didn t keep in a right temperature ,0
1045, Hard to find the taxi entrance so getting the bags down the stairs is a bit tricky but the staff are happy to help ,0
1046,No Negative,0
1047, All is not good breakfast expensive bed horrible and water is not hot for shower Likewise bedroom was not clean ,0
1048, We didn t take the overpriced breakfast instead we went to a cafe a few steps away ,0
1049, The rooms and corridors were much to hot however I was able to lower the temperature in the room There is absolutely nothing else to complain about A lovely hotel,0
1050, There wasn t a full length mirror in the room We were going to an event and could have done with it in addition a magnifying mirror to put on eye makeup ,0
1051, Unfortunately the safe wouldn t unlock they tried drilling it for 1 2 hour couldn t stand anymore told them to take it away which they did and returned me the contents but had no other safe available I did get a breakfast for my daughter husband and me free ,0
1052, Wardrobe was not so big but ours room had a nice sofa zone that we use to leave stuff so in the end was all ok,0
1053, I realise that good accommodation is expensive in central London but neverthelessI feel this hotel is somewhat costly We were on a room only rate so I cannot comment on the breakfasts or dinners but breakfasts are readily available within a short stroll of the hotel ,0
1054, Just a little pricey would have liked to spend an extra day Maybe need to book very early to get a good deal ,0
1055, We didn t have a very good experience in the restaurant because of a problem in the kitchen half of the set menu was unavailable and no alternative was offered Service was very slow one hour and a Half for 1 burger 1 risotto and 2 pies ,0
1056, I can t think of anything that could have been improved ,0
1057, All minor issues The location of the room was good however I did expect to have both a shower and a bath in the room When we checked in we had a choice of either bath or shower not both which wasn t a massive deal There was also a note to say what was complimentary however there were a few of the items missing Also in the morning three times our door was knocked for the room to be cleaned well before check out time One opened the door to come into our room while we were still in bed sleeping ,0
1058, The food we ordered in the hotel restaurant wasn t available We had to venture out to eat instead ,0
1059, Several options on evening menu not available even ran out of chips ,0
1060, The Smart TV wasn t connected to the Internet So I couldn t connect my phone to tablet to it which kind of defeats the point of having a smart TV Also the view from the room was pretty much just the wall which ran alongside the building but on the ground floor you shouldn t really expect much else ,0
1061,No Negative,0
1062, really couldn t fault it ,0
1063, We brought friends to dinner and discovered very limited choice on the menu although we were compensated ,0
1064,No Negative,0
1065, Room smelt a little smokey and the towels didn t smell fresh slightly musty My in room breakfast pancakes went so hard I couldn t cut them which makes me think they were zapped to make them hot ,0
1066, Was not told about the 30 extra per night they charged you get it back at the end of your stay but does not go back into your bank for a few days This needs to be brought to people s attention before they arrive ,0
1067, While some staff were outstanding and performed very well e g Jesus Other staff were just rude to the level that I will not recommend this hotel to any of my network ,0
1068,No Negative,0
1069, We chose to decline the breakfast as it was overpriced and London has so much more to offer when it comes to food Pillows were too chunky,0
1070, All good ,0
1071, I didn t understand the continental breakfast setup My room didn t include breakfast A weetabix and pastry and tea ended up costing 18 pounds ,0
1072, No full length mirror in bedrooms Breafast quality could have been better servuce was lacking,0
1073, Being really really picky here more space on desk to lay out cosmetics to sit and do make up in comfort rather than using bathroom mirror ,0
1074, Room was too hot even with air con as could only put down to 19 degrees ,0
1075, I bought drinks at the bar not waiter service and they still tried to add the 8 service charge They were not happy when I queried it and asked for the money back Light lunch snacks were very average and overpriced,0
1076, Maybe a bit more choice for the breakfast but you already have eggs as you want them ,0
1077,No Negative,0
1078, In an ideal world the hotel would be a bit closer to the tube station although it was only a 10 minute walk away ,0
1079, We were put in a disabled room so no bath ,0
1080,No Negative,0
1081, Check in lady was quite abrupt and that s the first impression spoiled instantly Double room was booked via this site and but got told on arrival not advised that there are no double beds available and I will have to have room with two singles Disappointment number two and hope for comfy sleep gone AC unit in the room was making very loud clicking noise faulty stat occasionally Bose docking station only suitable for iPhone 4 do those still exist There was a sign about the bath mat in the bathroom but no bath mat At this price range it was somewhat disappointing experience ,0
1082, My room was opposite the lifts and was quite noisy which wasn t ideal when trying to work Would have been good if there was a sliding door in between the entry area and bedroom so it could be closed to minimise outside sounds ,0
1083, the heating was turned to 25 degrees in the room when we checked in so it was a bit warm ,0
1084, there was no bubble bath,0
1085, Room facing a wall ,0
1086, I was disappointed that there no sofa or armchir in the room as depicts in the room description The view offices 5 meter from my window The price of room service,0
1087, Need to put more milk and tea bags in the room but I find that problem during most of my stays in hotels The room was clean but there was a couple of hairs in the bath probably from the cleaner I DIDN T make a fuss and just washed them away you could tell the room was spotless everywhere else and it was just a mistake the bath had been cleaned ,0
1088, Nothing ,0
1089, Was difficult to see from afar where hotel is Had to literally be up close to realise yoi were at the right place ,0
1090, In the area around the hotel there was nowhere open for breakfast at all When we asked why its because it is mainly a commuter working area so we ended up not being able to get any breakfast not the Apex hotels fault may I add Advice would be if you have plans near the hotel definitely book breakfast at the Apex The concierge was also a little rude and unhelpful Not a big issue nor is that the hotels fault ,0
1091,No Negative,0

1093, One staff member on reception was a bit trite when queried why photo ID was required for a second time after checking in earlier in the day ,0
1094, The AC couldn t keep the room cool during the day even with the shades down About 1 3 of the TV channels didn t work due to weak signal Only one elevator bank for guests it s a walk from the higher number rooms There are other lifts but they re staff only ,0

1096,No Negative,0
1097, There really wasn t anything to dislike about this hotel ,0
1098, Regular customer of Apex City of London hotel They didn t know I was a returning customer upon arrival Breakfast should have been included for over 300 for a room ,0
1099, The room that I was given is smaller than what was shown when I reserved online and they immediately ask you to upgrade and pay more to get the bigger one The room view was to corporate offices so I couldn t open the windows no privacy inside the room because and because of that it was always lights on mode ,0
1100,No Negative,0
1101, The room was warm overnight despite the aircon being set to the lowest possible temperature ,0

1108, Location was ok but a lot of places were shut at weekend so there wasn t too much right on the doorstep ,0

1110, Nothing,0
1111, Nothing ,0
1112, It was an excellent hotel all round Nothing to complain about ,0
1113, We had an evening meal and the menu hadn t changed since our last visit ,0
1114, The noise and souproof in general specially from the inside the entrance door too close from the bed,0
1115, Breakfast was chaotic Slow and had to keep on asking for missing items Definitely the B team on that day Was better in previous stay ,0
1116, The really long and winding corridor leading to my room being a single person it was a bit spooky walking to the room late in the evening ,0
1117, Booked a room for 3 and were told it would be a sofa bed Didn t expect to be as comfy as a bed but also didn t expect it to be excruciatingly uncomfortable No sleep in preparation for a long drive home Also didn t notice we had no bedding for the sofa bed until we were all ready for bed at quite a late hour and then had to wait for it to be brought up A bit disappointing after a long day ,0
1118, Enjoyed it all ,0
1119, Only 1 small bottle of water left per day and our room never had the complimentary snacks Pringles and jelly beans during our 4 night stay ,0
1120, When we booked the photos saw a couch in the room our room didn t have one Actually this was not a problem I prefer to have more empty space Also there are no smoking rooms in this hotel and while this might be great for most visitors since I am travelling very often to London it will be a problem for me during winter months ,0
1121, None,0
1122, Staff in reception not helpful nore friendly Besides we had to wait 30 minutes to get a drink at the bar the waiter never came we had to go to the bar Poor service compared to the hotel ranking,0
1123, Nothing to improve wish I could ve stayed longer ,0
1124, We chose this expensive hotel because the photos on Booking com seemed to show a rooftop restaurant with views over London and were really looking forward to sitting there in the evening for a meal When we arrived we were told there was no such roof restaurant although they admitted they had previously had other guests who had expected the same The restaurant was indoors on the ground floor and adjoining courtyard on the ground floor The photos we had seen were of the terrace of one of the penthouse suites showing tables chairs and food We were really disappointed and felt the advertising had been misleading ,0
1125, Nothing,0
1126, The coffee was a bit weak but this is a small shortcoming in context ,0
1127,No Negative,0
1128, Staff were rude and not very pleasant to deal with at reception I also called in house service for a cup as we were only given one in our room I spoke to a very rude man who told me to call housekeeping but didn t give me an extension number Once I called reception they said they would called in house service but I still didn t receive the cup Perhaps this individual member of staff mentioned above begrudgingly didn t feel it was his duty P Also used the public computers at the reception but the printers didn t work Not much point of them being there in my view or perhaps just do some maintenance In summary great stay and I would stay again but a reminder to hotel that a smile goes a long way ,0
1129, area very quiet on weekends some shops closed as financial area but still only 10 15 mins walk to convent garden only issue with the room was that it was a few minutes walk from reception get a room on the side above the reception ,0
1130, Located in the business district thus a fair distance walk from most attractions and restaurants Limited view,0
1131, Can t think of anything we were so pleased with everything,0
1132, Very poor front desk service the morning we left We did not receive the wake up call we ordered and were very late leaving for the airport I attempted to get help from front desk staff who were very uninformed about transportation options to Heathrow a very basic piece of knowledge for hotel staff in London We ended up with a taxi that took 1 5 hours due to a bike race nobody at the hotel seemed aware of this either and cost about 125 If you re not from London be aware that this hotel is in more of a business district Many of the surrounding restaurants and shops were closed on Saturday We walked to Covent Garden for pretty much everything ,0
1133,No Negative,0
1134, Can t find fault with anything loved it ,0
1135, Room was not ready for us to check in The front desk staff who dealt with us were cold and impersonal No sense of personal individualised service ,0
1136, Access to the bar was difficult as there were some corporate events Understandable considering the quality of the hotel so not really a low point just a minor inconvenience,0
1137, Accessibility is terrible in the hotel we have a baby buggy and it was nightmare for us to enter and exit from hotel no ramps lots of steps hotel is very big and room corridors are like a maze there is only one lift the other one next to it is broken and not fixed in 6 days on the hotel you have go long way on maze like corridors front desk was also very rude on check in I had a problem with my credit card and the staff was not helpful and acted very rude,0
1138, Housekeeping didn t wash used cups didn t change duvet cover was clean on arrival dropped spoon and made a coffee stain ,0
1139, Milk had gone off in room facility plus only one packet of biscuits between us Staff seemed unable to activate second keycard for room and only one pair of complementary slippers instead of two Not enough vegetarian options on the restaurant menu ,0
1140, As above,0
1141, Two adjacent rooms were requested Upon arrival only one was ready ,0
1142, Room looked over by office block Strong smell of cleaning fluid in the room Staff gave us another room without hesitation,0
1143, Location for me but it is still very central ,0
1144,No Negative,0
1145, A bit mean with tea coffee milk etc The only outside seating area was very busy we couldn t get a table in the evening ,0
1146, Nothing,0
1147, Bar and food prices but then it is London and the whole City is a rip off ,0
1148,No Negative,0
1149, It would be nice if the waiter who brings the breakfast to the room was as friendly as all the other staff ,0
1150, The lighting was pretty dark Room lighting would go a long way instead of a lamp ,0
1151, Entering the hotel involved crossing an open courtyard and negotiating a number of steps As it was raining when we arrived we got wet and it was uncomfortable having to carry suitcases up and down steps ,0
1152, They gave me the barrier free room which was not as comfortable as expected View on a wracked street corner so I felt a bit disappointed in view of the rather high price ,0
1153, Details of the restaurant menus in the room might have encouraged us to use these as it was we ate out ,0
1154, Nothing could be better everything was excellent,0
1155,No Negative,0
1156, Skimpy with the tea biscuits coffee tray No opening window Bit pricey compared with other similar London stays ,0
1157, Nothing at all,0
1158, We had to change rooms which was easily done and quickly without a hassle because the air conditioning was not working ,0
1159,No Negative,0
1160, Nothing to complain about here ,0
1161, Cannot think of anything,0
1162, My self and my wife came to london for a weekend birthday celebration On arrival one of your staff members rudely asked us for our passports just because we look asian we were both born in the uk and explained this She then carried on asking us for our passports even after we told her we have british passports She then asked how long we have been in the country Very very rude discriminatory spoilt our weekend We have used holiday inn many times before but will never use it again we feel very strongly about this will be submitting a formal complaint online review REGARDS MR SURJ DHAMI ,0
1163, The place is designed by someone who thinks design is more important than comfort By the end of the trip I found the walk along the very long corridor to my room was almost painful The room was ridiculously dark It was a big room but with one small window For that reason alone I would never stay there again The air conditioning could not be turned low enough to make a difference Almost every night I was woken up because it was too hot to sleep even on top of the bed The staff did not say hello to me once and I was there for five nights The cost was extortionate given the pleasantness of the facility But it was then suggested to me that I had taken things out of the minibar which was untrue Not to be repeated ,0
1164,No Negative,0
1165, Kippers they forgot our order and when they came they were very small and dry Try Loch Fyne kippers Best not to have kippers on the menu if they are not up to standard ,0
1166, Only tiny issue the internet was slow and the firewall prevented me from remote access to my server which was based in London not that far away so that was a major inconvenience as on my last day I had to work ,0
1167, Bar prices but that s London for you ,0
1168,No Negative,0
1169, Can t really think of anything,0
1170,No Negative,0
1171, For 3 days straight I found the staff dumped my cloths on the floor luckily with the cloth clean bag The room cleaning did not reach the standard level of services ,0
1172, Laundry dry cleaning rates Whilst service and product is excellent the cost seems much too high ,0
1173, Nothing,0
1174, The breakfast and drinks at the bar were quite expensive we went to a place around the corner and got breakfast for 2 people for under the cost of 1 person at the hotel,0

1238, It would be nice if it was a bit cheaper ,0

1240,No Negative,0

1259, Only a one night stay ,0
1260, The room itself was clean and of a good size but lacked in any form of character It felt like a place for business rather than somewhere you would go for lesiure It was a stereotypical hotel room very basic design art on the walls you d expect to be in every other room no character or unique qualities The view from our room was also dissapointing a concrete wall It made the room very dark However not all rooms can have a view and that is understandable In this instance I was after something more romantic but for those who aren t this hotel is perfect and cannot be faulted for its cleaniliness and quality of staff ,0

1300, The bed was uncomfortable the bath was not able to be emptied due to a faulty waste system and perhaps most disappointing was the club lounge which only served drinks with no snacks One of the fridges was broken and the coffee machine was temperamental A poor experience compared to the Hilton or other equivalent lounges I wouldn t have minded that much but I purposely opted for the more expensive room with lounge access ,0
1301,No Negative,0
1302, Rude reception staff at check in Rooms were not ready and we had to wait in one room for 45 mins then when we enquirer where our other 2 rooms were going to be ready we were told not yet when we were eventually given our rooms they were not fully serviced and once used the key card would not work but apart from the check in the hotel was great,0
1303, We were unable to check in when we arrived and had to wait until half 2 by which time we were off to the ballet and did not arrive back at the hotel until 6 o clock However being the weekend before Christmas I can understand the hotel was very busy and the staff were as helpful as they could possibly be ,0

1356, Only minor thing was room wasn t ready 2 hours after we could have checked in We then waited another hour with a complimentary drink it didn t detract from our stay but if we had waited 3 hours it would have time from check in to room ready ,0

2010, The room was appalling I had originally requested a room with a balcony as a special request and I understand that may not always be possible In saying that they gave me a room in the basement Supposedly it was a bonus gift from them as it was a bigger room to what I had originally booked Which made me think how small could my room have been if this so called bigger room was this small There was a window with three magnificent view of the buildings pipe work There was a constant noise out the window from a machine of some sort There was not much room to hang clothes or put things away There was a tiny built in wardrobe which could barely fit a handful of tops but the room was for 2 I will not be staying here again ,0
2011, The change of hotel story it repeated with every gusts so I have reviewed some of gust comments before and I faced the same If you booked a room for three adult which is queen bed and sofa beds you will stay in the basement which I will not recommend So the only room fit 3 adult is in the basement otherwise they move you up in room with extra bed for non adult The room pic dose not match the reality ,0

2015, Our first room had water leaking from the ceiling room above dripping down into our room We had to change rooms and the staff refused to give a monetary refund discount for the inconvenience I asked to speak with the manager about my disatisfaction and for 7 days was put off Additionally the ac was very loud did not work well and I was always hot The junior suite was too small for 3 people The sheets were not changed for 7 days Choose a different hotel ,0
2016, Our rooms were in underground floor it s nothing specifically bad but was not mentioned during booking Unstable wi fi signal in the room but still working The worst part is tiny bathroom It combines toilet and shower on a very small patch and if you are not alone after one person takes a shower everything around like floor toilet is absolutely wet ,0

2019, It s very close to another hotel with almost the same name so we went to the wrong one first not really their fault Checking in was very chaotic it was very busy Some people had been double booked Also when we went to check in at 2 15pm one of the rooms wasn t ready as they had a late check out which I didn t think was a very good excuse The hotel was OK but it was expensive for what you got it s the location you re paying for ,0
2020, Run down needs new furniture and painting Not clean enough and when cleaner comes with just polish and a rag then you know it s not being cleaned good enough ,0

2026, Room was extremely small with very strange walk in wardrobe space I feel the layout of the room and the dark wood did not help Not good if you are claustrophobic Also as we were in an internal room we were unable to open the windows Bathroom tiny but adequate with a fantastic shower Anyone of a larger build would struggle to move around in there I would suggest a taxi from the station or underground if you have any luggage as its approx a 7 10 minute walk and there are a few junctions to negotiate ,0

2064, No fridge and only plug sockets were far away other than that the room was faultless ,0
2065, Booked a Club room when we arrived the room was under the Main Street and didn t even have any windows Hardly 4 Star and what you expect from a Club Room then we asked to be moved in the second room we didn t receive the complimentary Dressing Gowns 2 Bottles of Wine or fruit platter that you were suppose to get with a Club Room Also when going to shower ready for the theatre at 1600 there was no hot water which meant us having to have a freezing cold shower The Club Room Bar they advertise is actually the only bar and the same as everyone else you just go through a different door to get to it with the label Club Lounge on it and we got charged for everything we had in there so don t see the point in having it or the difference in what you get for paying for a better room Tottlag a waste of good money spent ,0

2070, Having to share a double bed instead of twin as advertised,0

2072, I didn t like the restaurant which was effectively the bar There was a single member of staff who had to do everything run the bar take food orders clear tables and take payments The food was just ok It wasn t a great experience ,0
2073, Shabby room facilities Poor wifi Poor TV options terrible interface and charging for movies Poor shower no screen no hands free attachment to wall bits falling off not very nice shampoo shower gel Long hallways with sloping floors Not very clever use of space awkward placement of wardrobe and desk May have been fine 10 years ago but not when compared to modern hotels who offer much more comfort for less or equal price ,0

2102, On arrival at Paddington Hotel we were told that there was no hot water and that we were being transferred to another sister hotel The Hotel was the same and was a nice hotel however as we had chosen the hotel due to its close location for all our planned activities being transferred to earls court south kensington was very inconvienient and distrupted our plans to the point that we were unable to make several visits that we had planned as we were unable to walk to the locations we had booked and had to spend extra monies and time using the tube taxis We received a voice mail from the hotel in the morning advising us of this fact but as we had already left for London we did not receive it ,0

2122, The mirror arrangements in the room were awkward to use for my wife The room One of the hidden wardrobes could have had shelves in it for extra storage The lack of double glazing meant we had to use the supplementary heater each evening Only one comfy chair made TV watching awkward and difficult We did not take breakfast as we considered the room rate should have been inclusive of b fast ,0
2123, The room 138 is small and I do not like having to shower in the toilet area Would much prefer a separate shower cubical this would stop me using this facility if I was given this room again as second time and not happy with the en suite facility Air con was adequate other guest complained of it on the day as well ,0

2140, Girls on reception weren t very friendly To request a late check out I had to call one hour before check out time 12 noon which was defeating the purpose of having an extra lye in as our flight wasn t until 9pm Even though the hotel wasn t fully booked was able to check via this website I couldn t book a late check out upon arrival ,0

2190, Was a bit strange going to the basement for a room ,0
2191, I booked a deluxe double and was told that the room had a queen size bed However the bed was pretty small The duvet was quite thin so I had to call down reception at 3am for a blanket Also the room was very small quite claustrophobic The next morning after checking out we went to the bar to have a coffee We are the only ones there the barman took our order then disappeared for 15 minutes and didn t make our coffees so we left Not good service at all ,0
2192, Sofa bed and the fact that you could not shut the door with the sofa bed up you had to lift it up to shut the door,0
2193, The breakfast room in the basement was a little chaotic with customers and staff everywhere The food was good but not a good dining experience not what I was expecting compared with the rest of the hotel ,0
2194, I booked a deluxe double room there was nothing deluxe about it The room was tiny Literally the smallest box room I have ever stayed in The bathroom towels were dirty and we had to request new ones be provided The shower curtain did nothing to prevent the water covering the entire bathroom floor Which meant there was nowhere to then stand at the sink without getting wet There were no plugs near mirrors which made getting ready difficult I resorted to using the TV to see my reflection as I blow dryed my hair The room quickly got condensation due to it being so small however no windows could be opened Altogether an awful experience and I will not be staying there again The pictures were completely disieving and the cost was ridiculous based on what we actually got Very very disappointing ,0

2215, The room was tiny even by standards for having stayed elsewhere in the U K The room on the 4th floor got too hot and the ac unit did not work neither did the hair dryer so we kept the window open ,0
2216, The room is way too small No matter how well appointed it is nothing the hotel does can make up for the fact that this feels like a rip off every single moment Barely any elbow room ,0
2217, The pipework in this building is very noisy and we could hear it people all night using the taps We also were originally placed in a room in the basement without windows which was not mentioned as a possibility in the room information ,0
2218, The shower was interesting as it was in the corner of bathroom with only the curtain separating it Needless to say the entire floor and a couple of walls and maybe the roll of tp were soaked following use ,0
2219, The bathroom could have a bathtub ,0
2220, We went to the wrong ParkGrand Paddington moments before and they were very rude staff before they told us that we were not staying in this hotel ,0

2222, The room was to small and there was not enough room or hanging space No place to hang your coat or sit ,0
2223, One member of staff was particularly grumpy but all others were perfectly happy ,0

2230, The shower wasn t designed particularly well as everything around you either got very wet or you got stuck to the shower curtain ,0
2231, The only thing I d say that could have been slightly better was the friendliness of the hotel staff they were OK but maybe need a bit more chat to there customers Also as I am a genius booking com member I had free late check out but I wasn t able to find out whether I could have this or not until the morning we were leaving which left us a bit uncertain with our day plans ,0
2232, Our double bed was two twins pushed together and I kept falling into the gap Bathroom was a wet room door kept catching on the shower rail door was damaged due to the damp nowhere to put toiletries or toothbrushes loo roll almost on the floor so got damp room was dark small had no mirror furniture was a bit worn looking I prepaid for our room 5 months ago on an old bank card when we arrived at the hotel they wanted a copy of the card I paid on I no longer had this The staff member insisted that I paid again on a bank card that I had on me and that she would refund the original amount paid onto the old card I was very annoyed about this as there was no mention of having to bring the card I paid on After paying again on my only debit card it left me 150 short for my husband s birthday weekend refund will take 4 working days I had prepaid so far in advance so that I could forget about it and splash out a bit whilst in london My husband and I very rarely get a weekend without our children or the money to enjoy ourselves so this dampened the Weekend for us ,0
2233, No satelite tv No parking at the hotel closest parking was 5 10 minute walk away in a pay display carpark,0
2234, I made the booking on behalf of my 18 year old son I am concerned that having booked in advance and paid in full for the room on my visa debit card at check in my son was asked to re pay on his card and that I was to be refunded This practice is unacceptable as it is only by chance that my son has a card and also as a student there was enough money in his account to pay for the room Having to make this unexpected payment caused limitations and cash flow issues for my son I had purposefully booked and paid in advance to avoid any complications In my mind there was to be nothing for my son to do except check in and enjoy his room prior to handing to Heathrow airport the following morning Please advise why this occurred and why this process is employed The reimbursement of my original payment is exceedingly slow It should be instant as monies being held for a period of time from both my son and myself is inadmissible Helen Jackson,0

2262, You could hear the traffic although the hotel is not located near a main road you can hear vehicles passing by ,0
2263, Staff could pay better attention to detail Eg I booked a wake up call and never received it When I let them know that they basically didn t care ,0
2264, Rooms were uncomfortable not properly cleaned very little space for clothing no shower curtain in bathroom so the entire floor got wet ,0
2265, My only small issue was I thought room service could go on a little later as it s a chain hotel but not a huge deal,0

2272, I had a bad experience with this hotel During check in the woman in front desk told me that they have problem in water heating system and they cannot accommodate me in this hotel due to this reason and they booked other hotel for me I felt uncomfortable by this offer since the second hotel was far away around 2 miles and the hotel was full of guests and no one of them was talking about heating system So I decided to to turn the table against them so I request from woman in front desk to show me the room For testing the water heating system by my self Suddenly her supervisor came I forget to take her name and it became clear that they have overbooking in this hotel It clearly proven they try to handel this problem by laying to the guests During that an European guest came for check in and the process for check in goes smothly I start shotting to the hotel staff by saying this hotel treat guests beased on nationality What a shame So the decided to give my room which was non refundable but they give me a very bad room with bad location Later they change the room I will never book again in this hotel ,0
2273, I booked for 6 nights instead of 5 I contacted them within 5 minutes of the booking but as it was a special deal they refused to amend the booking even though I contacted them straight way The built in panelling in the room was a bit dated and made it very narrow and difficult to get around the end of the bed ,0
2274, A shower curtain There was none which is the style but it sprayed water everywhere on the floor,0
2275, The hotel reserves the fee of your first night from your account but doesn t use that money when you pay for the room so you have an additional amount of money out of your account which isn t helpful when you want to use it for spending money You then have to wait for your bank to refund the money to use again so make sure your account has enough in it ,0
2276, Relatively compact rooms and small bathrooms Limited closet storage space for clothes,0
2277, There was nothing on this occasion that I didn t like If I was going to be picky I would of liked it to be closer to the main shops ,0

2279, Room was far too small window was so cold and drafty that we were all awake most of the night I ve never complained about a hotel before but it was awful The only place the cot would fit was in the window and the baby was genuinely freezing cold We had another young child so couldn t move rooms in the middle of the night Consequently we all had no sleep It really wasn t acceptable The room was too small really drafty and the curtains didn t actually meet so the youngest child was up at the crack of dawn too Really marred our holiday Hotel offered 50 back on the room but this really wasn t enough based on such a terrible night Such a shame because this place could be really great ,0
2280, See above,0

2284, The one time I did stay here and wasn t moved the room was large but with artificial lighting all around the perimeter On the ground floor right behind reception so could get noisy and also no power sockets to recharge any items Badly designed room Someone from the hotel needs to spend a night in the room to see the issues ,0
2285, Compact double is a very small room tight wardrobe space safe not big enough for laptop no mini bar and or complimentary drinking water Certain furniture fixtures looked quite used and could do with replacement refurbishment All in all a pleasant hotel though ,0

2287, The television and beside control didn t seem to work although that could have been me ,0
2288, Hot water working but worked out better for us in long run,0

2295, We were on ground floor with great bay windows but it must of been bin collection day so a bit of an early wake up call ,0
2296, The bedroom appeared small with all the wood around it The breakfast room was tiny for a full crowd and as was the bar where people could not enjoy a drink without listening to the table next door ,0
2297, Buffet breakfast was a bit expensive Rooms were a bit tiny but manageable,0
2298, The evening dinning area needs to be improved ,0
2299,No Negative,0
2300, No privacy The staff can come in any time although you lock the room from inside I found that quite shocking Never seen anything like this in my life The staff will knock but will NOT wait long enough They just barge in Also the wardrobes are a mockery of the word The layout of things in the room is quite awkward i e location of the kettle power charging points the so called wardrobes everything is at user un friendly location in the room ,0
2301, Originally placed in the basement which is totally depressing without a window however I did ask to be moved and they happily obliged ,0
2302, We booked a deluxe room however the room was very small and it was difficult to change clothes for our night out therefore didn t seem like a deluxe room ,0
2303, the bed was too firm and the pillows too hard Also the lighting in the bedroom wasn t too good and there was nowhere to plug in chargers near to the bed ,0
2304, What s with the breakfast confusion Can t British hoteliers just run a restaurant if they want to charge for breakfasts It was one price if booked the day before A higher price that morning Oops you re not on the list blah blah blah North American hotels have no problems dealing with this Put it on your room or pay on the spot No dual pricing So easy Please break the UK mode and make it easy ,0
2305, First night we had to stay in an extremely small room They did move us to a much larger room for the rest of our stay ,0
2306, Not much The bar closed earlier than I would have liked Surrounding area didnt have a lot going on but close enough to paddington station,0
2307, Our room was not serviced The bed was two single beds pushed together ,0
2308, The air conditioning was not working and I had to change the room in next day And I could not sleep well that night ,0
2309, The tea and coffee making facility was poorly positioned on bed side table in my opinion this could potentially be very dangerous due to limited space Need to find an alternative area ,0
2310, Suit space is very small bathroom without a tub or shower breakfas area is small closed and crowded I styed in suit with king bed size but I foud it tow mattresses not one with king size it s horrable while you are sleeping,0
2311, The heating didn t work Certainly not worth paying this much Staff were not very helpful or apologetic but rather claimed their screen in the reception said it was warm Soy milk at breakfast was either old or diluted with water,0
2312, Fire alarms kept on going off randomly bit disturbing Lighting in the room wasn t that great But overall a good stay with minor drops ,0
2313, The staff was very in co operative and the rooms were awful to say the least I was finally shifted to a bigger room but when I requested for check out till 3 PM on Friday the lady told me that till 2 it was okay and she will try for 3 Then she says that she will do it only till 1 and not till 3 No reason was given for this at all ,0
2314, Size of the bedrooms were small Had to phone each time for a ironing board Breakfast was mediocre No comfort in the bar Each time upstairs flushed the toilet or had a shower you could hear the water flushing down the pipes in our bathroom ,0
2315, deluxe double room significantly smaller than advertised Just a bed with a small ring of floor space around it closet and desk folded off the wall hotel also offers a compact double room that is not that different would only book deluxe double if you are a solo traveller Bathroom so small that there was a tiny drain in the center of it without separate shower so the bathroom got completely soaked with every shower ,0
2316, It wasn t mentioned that the room was a basement room and it was very different from the photographs on booking com The room was extremely dusty and we ended up constantly sneezing whilst in the room After we changed rooms we found the hairdryer not working It took a long time to deal with this in the evening The showers were weak in both rooms One day the keycard for our room stopped working and we had to get it changed Overall too many problems ,0
2317, The automated room was a bit hard to understand for non frequent travellers Staff should try to explain system or ask if the guest is familiar Was moved from one hotel to a sister hotel and offered free breakfast in recompense But no one told the sister hotel and no one told me how I could go about getting it ,0
2318, Deluxe double was tiny My partner is 6ft and hanging off the bed We were next to an elevator so loud noises all night Shower was dirty had mould all over it and no pressure TV was on a weird angle so you couldn t see it properly If u have big suit cases very crowded and pillows and bed were uncomfortable But saying that we spent hardly anytime in the room so location was great for us ,0
2319, Very poor value for money Very poor room despite it being what was classed as a deluxe Bed against window so had to scramble down the bed to get out Very disappointed and first time I ve had a poor hotel from Booking com,0
2320, The breakfast Bleak and poor for that price Even the pictures of it were faded and didn t give you a good impression of what was offered Should have been included in the price of the room if that is all they can serve ,0
2321, The room was very noisy we could hear a fan of some sort outside the bedroom which came on periodically and was very loud Every time someone in a room next door above or close to us flushed the loo or had a shower we could hear the water running through the bathrooms open drain The room was very small only one arm chair so when we had room service in the evening one of us had to sit on the bed to eat There is only enough wardrobe space for about 5 things to hang in When I asked why I hadn t got any complementary water I was told it was because I booked through you I made a fuss and did get it in the end but I felt like a cheap skate even though it cost me over 350 for the two nights ,0
2322, Room was tiny and dark I got moved around to a different property one block away because Park Grand had hot water issues Then when I checked into the second location they moved me across the street to a hard location Too much money for such a small room ,0
2323, The main mattress for the bed is too soft Feel painful for the back after sleep overnight The mattress for the sofa bed is too weak I still can feel the springs They can be good if you can choose the medium firm mattresses ,0
2324, Due to it s location its decor the the lounge bar area was not very comfortable to sit relax in It was the walkpath to go to all the rooms ,0
2325, Room was too small for 2 people A double bed with 2 mattresses does not pass as a twin Overpaid for what I got ,0
2326, The double room was so small there was no room to store bags Two people were unable to dress at the same time The walk in wet room was so small that when you turned on the shower it would completely soak the whole bathroom so no one else was able to use Friends staying in a suit were meant to of received complimentary soft drinks fruit and dressing gowns which were not provided The gym smelt as if it was being used as a smoking room Very disappointed in what appeared to be a lovely hotel with reasonable star rating ,0
2327, The shower water is hard I couldn t get the soapy feeling off even after washing for a while Also on arrival at the airport I called the the telephone given to me at booking which took so long to answer I also found the direction address given to me unhelpful In fact a lady on the line directed me to apparently another branch of the hotel that the one I booked for was under renovation I turned up at the place I booked and found no renovation going on and busy and I got the room I booked for Perhaps it was a mixup ,0
2328, The bathroom was not only small but the shower and toilet seem to be in the same position On showering there was water flooding the whole bathroom area The bathroom tiles were poorly put together with the grating sealant coming off quite easily It was just awful I will not book this hotel ever again in this Paddington area of London ,0
2329, Everything else you don t expect big and lavish rooms while staying in Central London however a room which has just 18 inches of space around the bed Washroom was also a disaster 140 plus per night is deserves more ,0
2330, One of us mobility impaired wish it were a little closer to Underground station,0
2331, the bathroom wasn t really hotel standard No counters to do makeup or blow dry hair The room was too close to the stuff pantry noisy all through the night Hotel stuff didn t bother to replenish towels or make beds properly Carpet in the room was dirty from the day we checked in,0
2332,No Negative,0
2333, We arrived in the early hours to check in after paying a taxi to take us to front door we were asked to walk to their sister hotel down the street where they then tried to check us in again and charge us again Then headed down to our room where the key card didn t work so headed back to reception they then came down with us and it still didn t work so told us to wait at the room They then returned and manually opened our door and said it couldn t be fixed until the next day It then soon dawned on us that we wouldn t be able to go for breakfast as we wouldn t be able to get back in our room The bed clearly hadn t been changed as there were other peoples hairs in the sheets and pillows my bedside table also had what I can only describe as orange zest all over it This was at 02 30 am so we decided to grin and bare as we were shattered Then the morning came our wake up call of a fire alarm at 09 00 wasn t exactly pleasant followed by the cleaners ringing the door bell several times and getting us out of bed even though we had until 12 00 to check out We left and couldn t get out fast enough after a very bad experience we found ourselves on a street we hadn t planned to be on with no idea which way to head hopefully we wont stumble across this hotel again It really was a shame as it looked as if the place was actually run by someone who cares it could have been lovely But at the tune of 173 00 for less than 10 hours we wont ever be going back ,0
2334, The hotel operators are cheats liars and thieves I booked a Double and even after calling them on the night of my check in to say that I was checking in late there was NO room for me when I showed up at midnight There was also a family with a toddler asleep on the couch in their lobby who had experienced the same thing They moved me down the street into a SINGLE and then were totally unreasonable about offering me a discounted rate refund on the lousy room BOOO Don t just walk run away from these crooks ,0
2335, Room a bit small ,0

2338, We were not give the size of room we paid for first night we had to complained Web mentions complimentary fresh fruit and water in rooms this did not happen Wardrobe space nonexistence even for one person let alone a couple The rooms were too compact Wash area needs care and attending to seals around basins and tiles,0
2339, Delayed checking despite not arriving till 7pm 3 bed was child size and like a camp bed towels for 3 provided but not cups glasses toiletries they were all for 2 Breakfast time was crowded in a small area meaning staff could not keep up with demand despite their best efforts No where near a 4 star more like 2 We don t understand how the AA rated as a 4 star Definitely not worth the discounted cost,0

2371, The Club Room was located in the basement with virtually no natural light The cafe restaurant was right next door to the room with grease odours permeating throughout the room The tiny room was decorated in dark stained chipboard and it looked as if it hadn t been decorated in years The room they moved us to the next day was better only as it was lighter Don t believe the pictures on the website The staff were clearly not trained in basic customer service as they had little knowledge of solving even the basic of issues and found it difficult to hide their annoyance when I had the ordacity to complain ,0
2372, Not unusual in London some rooms are small we upgraded to a bigger room for not much more money all the rooms look very newly refurbished and very well fitted out ,0
2373, The room was great for a solo traveller however space and wardrobe would have been a challenge for 2 of us especially if you needed to hang formal clothes The rainhead shower was awesome and the hand held option good If I had a full head of hair maybe a challenge if not wishing to wash it The UNenclosed shower great if you do not need to use the toilet or brush your teeth after in socks as the floor gets wet Again if 2 sharing would need back up of floor mats slippers etc ,0

2381, On arrival we were given a basement room where there was no mobile phone reception and wifi also poor because it was underground and attitude of reception staff was v rood and not helpfull at all despite I was with family no adjoining rooms were not allocated even after the request reception staff flatly refused and they always refers to talk to booking com However we were given 2 rooms on second day due to pressure Most dissapointing part was the attitude of staff male and female both were rood Sujith,0

2386, The fact that I wanted to extend the stay which they were unable to do where as when I rang them before leaving I was told I could So then I had no choice but to pay extra I felt the staff was useless ,0
2387, The staff at the bar was not really qualified WE ordered a bottle of Prosecco but instead of pouring the first glass as one would expect the just left informing us 10 minutes later that WE would need to pay as they are closing We got a room in the basement which is considering the price I would have liked to know prior to my stay ,0
2388, Not sure it was the problem of the hotel or booking com The triple room I booked was canceled due to inefficient credit card I provided However the card is totally fine when I checked in to the hotel This cost a great trouble during our first night in the hotel ,0
2389, As mentioned staff have no authority to help the guest always they have to back the main office,0
2390, they gave us a room in the basement then when we wanted to change we had to wait more than one hour we were there at 8 pm don t know they did this because was a late arrival But it was a very bad beginning and not easy to get over because the second room provided had a window over a climatisation area and was very noisy 24 hour ,0
2391, The first girl on reception was a bit over the top the rest of the staff were lovely I was over charged for two extra nights I just emailed hoping to get a refund,0

2398, The staff in room service over the phone were rude the bathroom was a wet room which flooded everytime you had a shower as the plug was blocked the room was very small just big enough for a double bed ,0
2399, Bathroom was ridiculously small and tight Shower sprayed all over the small floor making it slippery as did the tiny sink The rooms are faded and dated and didn t strike me as very clean Would not book here again ,0
2400, Maybe some better refreshments in the room instead of wine but other than that couldn t fault it ,0
2401, Didn t appreciate the small room originally allocated given I was staying 7 nights Had issues with the bathroom of the new room allocated as well but friendly staff sorted it out ,0
2402, I hated the fact that there was no Lip on the shower the entire bathroom was wet after one of us had a shower never saw this in a hotel before The room was very small for a so called deluxe double The hair conditioner was never replaced ,0
2403, Check in seemed unnecessarily fussy in terms of things that needed a signature I ve checked in to other hotels through bookings com before and hardly needed to sign anything on arrival Also although I didn t go in to the club room it didn t look anything special through the windows and certainly nothing worth upgrading your room to have access to I didn t see the point of it ,0
2404, All good nothing to dislike ,0
2405, We were given a twin beds pushed together that kept separating whenever someone went near the middle and also were given a room in the basement had a frosted window so there was some natural light but not able to open it or have a view Asked for both things to be fixed and the staff were unable to do anything except put a sheet over the two beds Staff were generally unhelpful and snooty no information given at check in,0

2411, A lot of chipped and broken furniture Not much room in restaurant for a busy hotel Television was confusing to operate Loud air conditioning ,0
2412, At the location we booked they said there were issues with the room so we had to go to a different location something this hotel seems to do a lot looking at the other reviews The other location was just around the corn we but the room we were given was definitely not the size we booked ,0
2413, No curtains in room and staff very unhelpful when told about them told we should have complained the night before but we did not notice as it was late when we got to the room Staff refused to deal with the complaint ,0

2418, Called up hotel to ask if I could leave a bag two days prior to check in and was informed this was OK On coming to the hotel I was informed I could not do so I would not have minded if I was given the correct information when I first called Secondly the receptionist on duty did not handle the situation well she was unsympathetic and said I may have misunderstood what was told to me by phone implying either I do not understand simple English or perhaps am too stupid to understand The halogen lights in the room are too bright and glaring ,0

2423, Wardrobe space could have been bigger,0
2424, Room was very small and the wardrobe is only about 4 inches deep within a wall panel the bedside table below it made it very difficult to reach If only there for a night this would be acceptable but there was 2 of us for 4 nights This was described as a deluxe room and was told be reception staff that you need to book a club room to get anything bigger ,0
2425, Room and shower room very small Shower room was pointless as water just went everywhere and had to use all the towels to dry so that I could continue using facilities Lady serving drinks in bar was not qualified to serve as had no idea how to mix certain drinks ,0

2435, What s not to like ,0
2436, Hot breakfast didn t look very good very pale scrambled eggs not quite up to the standard of the rest of the hotel and breakfast Very limited wardrobe space ,0
2437, The continental breakfast was a bit too expensive ,0

2446, I was moved to this hotel on checking into my original hotel Receptionist informed me that because of the change I was going to get breakfast inc when I went to the room I had been allocated it was very small in comparison to my original room I had booked I was disappointed and told staff who informed me that it was the only room available but I could check with her again in the morning Breakfast was ok but a very small area to move around in Think I was probably overcharged as well ,0
2447, My bag was stolen from the hotel lobby and that speaks a lot on poor management and lack of security It took the hotel half an hour to view the cctv footage and i think the response from the management was atrocious I lost a lot of money and as a traveler it was a nightmare to be in an alien city without any help from the management The management did not even apologies for what has happened I would advise Booking com to withdraw the hotel from their system and also advise travellers to not to stay at this hotel Imagine a bag being stolen from the lobby of the hotel Very poor attitude and shockingly unbelievable behaviour ,0
2448, The staff is unorganised I ve booked the hotel through booking com and I ve paid for the room in advanced The staff kept on letting me put in my card again and again thinking that I haven t pay yet Which made me late for the meeting Also I ve arrived an hour later than the time they set for the check in and my room is still not ready ,0
2449, 1 I booked a deluxe room a couple with 6 months infant and noted my late check in by calling the hotel Upon arrival no one helped us with the babystroller and our 3 bags receptionist was looking and waiting 2 we have been given a room that is just a door and you directly must hop on the bed I doubt if it is suitable for human being though we have an infant and I ve been told ooh ok that was our last room sleep and squeeze your baby and tomorrow we give you another one 3 in that room no refrigerator to keep my baby s milk and food I guess that is illegal and no one cares 4 there is no shampoos no soap nothing at all a blocked sink 5 next day another room and offered me a breakfast to please us after I spent the night sleeping under the bed to give a space to my child 6 I just had a look at the breakfast sorry this is not something to offer I moved away immediatly 7 The hotel is outdated and rubbish 8 They took extra booking price compred to the one I see on booking with a difference of 100 USD,0
2450, The room was slightly cramped There was an unnecessary mix up with the registration which resulted in our getting a smaller room but had free breakfast thrown in instead ,0
2451, The hotel good location and clean but some staff very badly with me really I surprised from them They should be more professional and helper all coustmers they need more study and qualify in field hotel business Bcz the price increasing more that 150 that not accepted in any hotels and countries special in UK we like UK Thanks,0

2455, View from room was of a wall looking at another part of the building ,0

2466, Nothing really other than room maybe slightly small for 3 people but manageable ,0
2467,No Negative,0
2468, Despite 5 rooms being paid for IN FULL in advance with a company credit card the hotel were still worried about something what I don t know so they insisted the person named on the credit card to be present even though they had already been paid Ridiculous One of our travellers paid for breakfast then when she sat down for breakfast they told her she had not paid when she had We will NOT be using this hotel again ,0
2469,No Negative,0
2470, The room was overall filthy i doubt if the bed sheets were changed before my arrival and the toilet cleaned found human hair in both The corridor smelled burned cooking oil from the kitchen It was one of the most disgusting hotels I ve stayed at It certainly didn t worth the amount of money i paid for it ,0
2471, The breakfast buffet was ample but not high quality products I would suggest going elsewhere for a good English breakfast ,0
2472, We were there for 5 days it would be nice to have something different for breakfast not the exact same thing everyday There was only one elevator so sometimes it was a bit of a wait ,0
2473, I was moved on arrival despite only booking that day Apparently there were maintenance issues but it didn t stop the group in front of me checking in The hotel I moved to was further away from where I needed to be small room was not the cleanest a bit tired and not somewhere I d have chosen to stay Overpriced and dissatisfied ,0

2480, Room not available on time Staff helped someone behind us before helping us Hotel insisted on photocopying my identification which I refused breakfast disappointing,0
2481, The room was very difficult to access within the building which consists of townhouses that have been remodeled as a hotel We had to go up an elevator up some stairs down some others and it was confusing long and very difficult to handle with our heavy bags Thankfully the staff is attentive and responsive and there to help with luggage Another issue was that while the bed and room was clean the window was very dirty The window was also small due to the location of the room within the building ,0
2482, The people behind the desk really ought to be able to read the details of a booking properly to avoid guests being misdirected to a considerably smaller room This took too much time to correct ,0
2483, Bed was hard as a rock Worst nights sleep ever Bedroom was squashed was tiny no need for the word deluxe far from it No breakfast included and already paid 141 pound to stay Never staying again ,0

2487, poor staff that couldn t help me having to pay for the room before I checked out having a damp basement room that shouldn t have been rented out water stains on the ceiling,0
2488, The booking was done for Deluxe Double room and from 23rd I called them ahead to tell them I will be checking only on 24th Morning I land up to find the reservation was on hold even though they had charged me on the previous day itself Once it got unblocked they provided me a Compact Room where if you walk you will hit a wall When I enquired about the same the staff was unapologetic and started explaining how the Victorian buildings tend to become smaller on higher floors When I was not buying the story they provided me the actual Deluxe Double Room that is more comfy The staffs arrogance and lack of coordination is seriously needs to be looked at During all these commotion that manager didn t even bother to come out from his Palace ,0
2489, Nothing springs to mind I didn t take advantage of the breakfast deal Portobello Market was waiting so couldn t rate that ,0

2500, a socket for plugging your phone next to the bed ,0
2501, Room was a bit tired the air unit or heater or whatever buzzed all night which was very annoying and storage closet space was limited London itself has become a tarpit foul air congestion and everything and I mean everything is so grossly overpriced The city probably tainted my view on the hotel somewhat but I will never visit London again other than perhaps in transit to somewhere more pleasant ,0
2502, The facilities were very basic Breakfast was expensive and extra The location is a little out the way and the food offer is very basic The room was very basic bed was comfortable Check out was a nightmare ,0
2503, Nothing negative to stay the place is wonderful,0
2504, got moved to park grand paddington court and was allocated to the basement should have a choice of not preferring basement before,0
2505, I was expecting a delivery at the reception and despite having a confirmation of the delivery the night staff refused to give it to me arguing that it has never been delivered It is only when I ve threatened them to call the police that my package suddenly reappeared without the slightest apology Outrageous I strongly advise you to chose another hotel if you have any concern for your belongings ,0
2506, The room for the price When I went through booking com I looked at the pictures under the room I was booking The room I got and the pics of the room was completely different ends of quality I m lucky I complained and they gave me an upgrade 150 pounds for this I wouldn t have paid 75 for it ,0
2507, Nothing to dislike,0
2508, my only issue was at check in where the reception staff sought to take an imprint of my credit card using an old swipe machine Although this was procedure I objected to any swipe of my card I am happy to leave holding deposit for additional costs but refused The staff to be fair didn t argue I have stayed at sister hotel without problem ,0

2510,No Negative,0
2511, I like to sleep with the windows open which meant I was disturbed by street noise in the early hours my husband is a heavier sleeper so heard nothing ,0

2513, there was a terrible noise all throughout the night sounded like there were pipes rattling really loud every time I opened the bathroom door i could hear next door as thought they were in the room with us The hotel charged me a 91 retainer prior to arrival which i still havent been refunded ,0

2515, They dont clean the room very well i give them 7 from 10,0
2516, Menu and lack of room service at certain times Some rooms are really noisy you can hear full conversations of the people next door There are other rooms where a huge fan goes off outside The building needs better Windows to keep the noise out ,0
2517, Breakfast could be better More yogurt choices larger croissants more fresh fruit Service was great there and in the bar Cappuccino was bitter Machine may need cleaning ,0
2518, Rooms are very small hardly any space to move Every day 2 small bottles of water be provided There should be atleast one more electric socket ,0
2519, The room is very very small The room was not cleaned daily So far from the stations tube and bus It s for sure not a 4 stars hotel as it s part of a residence building ,0
2520, Went for a club room Badly designed with bed base taking up way too much space making it hazardous in the night added furniture wasn t helpful and the only plug points were in the drop down desk tv could only be viewed from bed so two chairs were no use and neither was the formal desk bathroom was a wet room cubicle that soaked everything when in use as the shower curtain kept sliding away,0
2521,No Negative,0
2522, It was a very noisy hotel We were woken at 6 30 by the people upstairs walking backwards and forwards across the room and could hear toilets flushing etc We were in the basement No other complaints,0
2523, I booked a deluxe twin room As per the photos it looked good enough When we got into the room which was hardly 3m x 3m I thought I made a mistake because it had a king size bed with two single mattresses on it with 10 cm gap between them instead of two single beds we went to the reception to check they said this is the only available room and we can t give you your money back The room was so tiny we hardly had any space for our baggage Staff all look unhappy the breakfast experience is even worse Good staff but greedy greedy management and owners Really bad experience ,0
2524, Silly question nothing ,0
2525, They must have had experience with folk not paying due to the way they went on about payment by card being automatically taken for one night Indeed payment seemed to be the focus and take priority when checking in Not a real negative but after a hard day working in London after a long commute and turning up for a really nice relaxing experience left one feeling a little oh ok that s how it is then Room was small and in the basement and you could see people walking right by on the pavement above while standing by the window when talking on the phone which I had to do since the signal was poor However it could make for an amusing gentleman s past time for someone else of course when the summer really kicks in and skirts get shorter They seem to pack rooms into that building and neighbours are easily overheard Room was rather soulless and didn t have any character or charm at all There was a small long thin vase with 2 real Carnations in which was a nice touch but it fell over and spilt the water on the floor due to the naff round metal glass table it was on being very un level as soon as I tried to move it out of the way of the pop out desk I mopped the water with a towel btw The Air Con was making a racket so I turned it off but a fan was still whirring and randomly screaming all night regardless Despite consuming several pints at the Mitre down the road in a solely medicinal attempt at ensuring slumber of any reasonable length I only got 3hrs sleep But I don t sleep very well in hotels anyway and use earplugs I was alone but the wife snores at home so is a habit so wasn t sure if the fan thing was enough of an issue to try and switch rooms During checkout I wasn t asked about my stay so didn t bother to mention it Room 114 guys beware ,0

2529, My room was in the basement If I needed to stay more than 1 night that would make me feel uncomfortable I should have been told during booking that the room was in the basement ,0
2530, They assign you a different room then you reserved and lie in your face that it s the same one Insects on on bedclothes They give you one towel for two guests The air conditioning was going crazy loud every 15 minutes during the night The room is so small it s hard to walk ,0
2531, The shower was cold and unfortunately so was the room The little heater provided didn t work at all ,0
2532, 15 min walk from Pasdington station My room was on 1 floor was a bit dark and very much noise from the outside The shower is just a hole in the floor so the floor of the bathroom is always wet,0
2533, We were made to move hotels because of hot water issues The mattress was yellow with stains If i had noticed this before the morning we certainly would not have stayed in that room I was informed the next day that they had thrown the mattress out it certainly couldn t have been cleaned The headboard was stained The staff were thoroughly unhelpful they couldn t even get me some new batteries for the remote control A second bed had been crowbarred into our room and made it impossible to open the fridge ,0

2537, Booked via booking com and paid extra 10 to have the refundable option and to pay on check out However the hotel didn t inform me that before my stay they were going to take half the money out the week before my stay resulting in me nearly cancelling my card Also I had to pay on check on no issues to either but should have been informed ,0

2543, Room should have a fridge for fresh milk and soft drink storage Soft drinks and better biscuits should be provided in the room,0

2548, The air condition was noisy when on or off so interfered with my sleep There was also a little bit of a leak coming from the shower head The fire alarm had gone off as well Could have done with 2 room keys As my daughter had gone off to do her own thing and so did I She got to the room before me so had to wait for me to let her in as I had the room key ,0
2549, There was a strange smell in the hotel and our room was next to a machine that make a lot of noise ,0

2552, Staff not overly very helpful or assisting on checkin about the hotel or facilities ,0
2553, The room rate is too high compared to the services provided The room service could have been better I stained my sheets with coffee and makeup on my first night and when my room was cleaned the next morning the cleaners failed to change my sheets ,0
2554, You could hear most things in the adjacent bedrooms and because there were no net curtains or light blinds and my window was facing the internal lightwell if I opened my curtains I could see straight into the bedroom opposite ,0
2555, No window in the room ,0
2556, I didn t like the very small window in the attic room made me feel a bit claustrophobic Would have been nice to have a small bedside light for reading ,0
2557, room a bit on the small side and pillows a bit hard I run a guest house in cornwall you could cut your bread bill in half we were given 4 large slices of toast with our breakfast far too much if people want more they can ask for it also there is nothing worse than butter from the fridge that is rock hard ,0

2559, even though we were told we had been upgraded the room was quite small ,0
2560, No control for heating small wardrobe space and nowhere to hang coats The room was very big though so not much of a problem ,0
2561, The bathroom was very small and had no actual shower cubicle or tray just a shower curtain and a drain It worked well enough but the addition of a shower tray would have made it much more pleasant to use ,0
2562, The staff on arrival weren t clear in fact one told me my booking wasn t with them and I was at the wrong hotel Also at the time of booking i d been informed the room was paid when in fact it had only been reserved the staff were quite rude handling this situation When I got to my room I called for room service as I was shattered I was told by a member of staff that I couldn t order anything as the kitchen was closed she was rude in the manner in which she said this and this ultimately left me feeling frustrated I went out to grab something and used a plate within the room there was a can opener on top of the plate which was encased in food or remains of something this made me feel sick Someone had obviously not checked the cleanliness of this area in some time Great location staff could do with customer service training I would never stay there again ,0
2563, Standards rooms are small but price is low for central London Club rooms are decent size ,0
2564, The room was a little cramped but somewhat expected for London ,0

2569, The room was a little bit warm There was a fan in the room but it didn t make much of a difference ,0
2570, The room was too small we paid for a delux double but it was tiny the aircon system is also too noisy ,0
2571, Their idea of separate beds was two mattresses 3 cm apart from each other with no possibility to move them The feedback form in the room was for some other hotel chain ,0
2572, The maid service was a little hit and miss glasses not cleaned replaced sugar not replaced there was no mobile signal in our room We paid extra for a club room but didn t really see any benefit the room itself was at the back of the hotel with no view apart from a wall and the only upgrades I noticed were 3 pieces of fruit and some rather scratchy robes ,0
2573, Rooms was dated not particularly clean and with a very noisy air conditioning unit in the room when opening the windows because we were near the restaurant we had more noise from those units Poor considering this was a deluxe room needed a complete refurbishment,0
2574, Rooms were much smaller than I thought Thought it was a 4star hotel and did not seem like it Good thing i got a good price from booking com ,0
2575, Couldnt fault it ,0

2580,No Negative,0
2581, As already stated there was nothing that we did not like ,0
2582, Checking the fridge for food and drink left behind would have been good A little more milk in the room would have been nice We weren t really there longer enough to request more ,0
2583,No Negative,0
2584,No Negative,0
2585, However I did not like how I went into the first room and the ceiling was all opened and I went to reception and instead of doing a room move straight away they doubted my word had to check first and then they moved me plus they knew it was a special occasion so they could be more careful with how they do things,0
2586, The location wasn t the best for where we were going but nice to be away from the centre,0
2587, Slight mix up and had to go tongue sister hotel then the sent me back to the original as there was a problem with the original room Room was stated as delux but was quite small,0
2588, Check in wasn t available when we arrived at 10am However it wasn t really a big issue as we could leave our cases until we came back ,0
2589, I ll start off with the location was good for what we needed But It was freezing cold in the room all night I had to call to ask for extra blankets at 4am felt like I was camping outside Had to call twice and wait 25minutes to get an extra blanket The room was an ok size but didn t expect our seperate beds to be together There was one plug outlet for the room as well which was frustrating The throw blanket on the bed was torn and stained as well so that wasn t very nice Noise coming from upstairs and next door We only needed it for the night so I guess it did what I needed to do but I probably wouldn t stay there again ,0
2590, No phone signal in my room A bit small room even it s compact double room,0
2591, 1 In this day age the fridge should be a standard however it was not as apparently only available in Club Rooms 2 No slippers or bathrobes either though they did provide the former on request after a little coercion 3 Lat time I had booked a Club Room but it didn t have a proper shower area hence I chose the Deluxe Double this time by checking the bathroom pics beforehand However strangely this had some other items missing like the fridge bathrobes I just don t get it how does it all balance out ,0
2592, The room smelled of old cigars and the air conditioner blew cold and toxic air you over charged me for breakfast I was one person and was charged for two people,0
2593, Furniture in club room very tired worn Shower curtain fabric don t like this sorry and shower room very small Tiles of wet room floor cracked too Booked a double room enquired to see if I could change to twin but could only offer same bed base with 2 single mattresses so declined that When checking in was given twin room even though had asked for double to remain Central reservations not easy to deal with on this ,0
2594, This is not a 4 star hotel in my opinion decor is worn out in places toilets in the main enterance for example where wood was exposed on the skirting breakfast although very nice was too pricy 14 99 Room small they call it boutique but really it is just small The room we had had an enterance hall which was good for storing buggy ect but given that it was a room for a family with a baby access was on the first floor via a lift then we had to go down a flight of stairs to get to the door to our room No bt sport in room or bar so unable to watch a big champions leaugue match surely a 4 star hotel can afford to provide this for guests ,0
2595, Air conditioning left room cool even when set to 25 degrees Thin walls could hear man next door snooring,0
2596, we were on the very top floor when we got into the hotel room it was uncomfortable hot we had to phone down late at night and ask them to turn it down as we couldn t sleep had both windows wide open and the air con on The matress was uncomfortable it was rock solid we didn t get a full night sleep as we were too hot and very uncomfortable The second night in we were up watching TV and the electrics blew we had to phone down and get them to come and sort it which was very irritating afterwards the light over the shower did not work So overall not a good stay we would look elsewhere next time which is such a shame because it was such a lovely hotel and the staff were great ,0
2597, Be aware that the sister hotel is just along the same road displaying a large Park Grand sign outside The staff are used to directing new guests to the correct hotel ,0
2598, There was a humming sound in the room in the nights and it was really small They start vid some reparing on out floor early in the mornings strong smell from spraypaint The toiletdoor is right by the bed Rood staff in the reception both checking in and out ,0
2599, I didn t like the noise came when you switched the heating on at a certain temperature I didn t like not having much off a view from window looking on to other rooms,0
2600, Air condition was noisy Pillows were lumpy I changed the room twice but as You were full I had to have the first room anyway The second room was cold and the shower room floor icy ,0
2601, Stayed in room 309 Club Room damp carpet by shower room noisy plumbing and a strange smell ,0
2602, The cupboard where the hairdryer was didn t open all the way around making the mirror on the inside impossible to use unless you leant across the table Not a big problem just poor design ,0
2603, TV could have been a little bigger,0
2604, Breakfast hall was located in basement restaurant so bit akward to find initially,0
2605, room was cold the heating was not efficient despite setting the temperature to 32C room was dark only small windows overlooking a wall 2m away internet was slow not enough for Skype call ,0
2606, I booked a double room but it turned out to be 2 single beds pushed together We found it very uncomfortable Also the beds had seperate single bed sheets on them so no effort was made to even make it appear like a double bed double sheets at least would have been a start Breakfast instead of new unpealed potatoes chips would be better The sausages were undercooked and the beans were cheap I WAS REALLY DISSAPOINTED when we returned back from breakfast we noticed that someone had came into our room and stolen a mars bar that was on the bedside cabinet It made it worse by the fact it was a double mars bar so someone had torn it open and taken half then just left the other half in the torn wrapper and left it on the table I reported this incident to the duty manager she said she would look into it I really do not expect this kind of thing to happen especially in a reputable place like this It s not the item itself that i m concerned about but it s rather the value of principle ,0
2607, I can t say anything bad ,0
2608, Rooms are very small Not a lot of space even in the deluxe Double mirror is far from Plug so Could not Straighten my hair Shower door did not close properly Too expensive,0
2609, The room was quite small and the view was quite bad but okay as we only stayed for a night,0
2610, To all weary travellers I booked a four night stay at The Park Grand hotel in London Paddington Having just arrived from a long journey and I checked into my room and went straight to bed Not long after drifting off to the land of nod I awoke to a burning sensation severe itchiness to my upper torso neck hands and arms Upon further inspection I soon discovered the bed was riddled with bedbugs and these free loaders I counted in the double digits After contacting reception I was greeted by the hotel manager and an assistant to assess the extent of the infestation By this time my bites had swollen to a collection of bright red bump The manager and equally his assistant were shocked at the state of the bed and they moved me to the room down the hallway The following morning I spoke to another manager to request a full refund for the previous night as well as requested relocation to a lower floor just in case my new friends decided to pay me another visit The manager advised me that a full refund was not practical and that the best they could do for me at the time was to give a 20 discount on the room which I did not accept for the previous evening and wash my clothes to prevent any stowaways At one point throughout the discussion the manager even intimated that I may be responsible for the infestation and that he would investigate the situation adding insult to injury This certainly did put me at ease and I did not feel like a valued customer Instead of giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt and continuing my stay I requested that my room be cancelled and to refund the remaining nights As anticipated I was told that I should give 24 hours notice in order to cancel so I had to stay one more night before leaving to a neighbouring hotel I short the attitude of the hotel was woeful and the manner in which they dealt with their customers albeit the general staff was pleasant and helpful ,0
2611, Everything was suburb I would consider myself a regular at the hotel and every time I go it is always great service,0
2612, The gym was good but I would have appreciated a yoga mat pilates ball and some more weights,0
2613,No Negative,0
2614, Bathroom was teeny tiny but very functional clean so not really a didn t like more an observation,0
2615, Poor Wi Fi connection We missed a cosy lounge There was no where to hang our winter coats in the room Bathroom had not enough room for our toiletries and no toilet brush For a Dane the bread at breakfast was not satisfactory only white and dry ,0
2616, the bathroom was a mess 4 star hotel with no shower cabine just a shower head and curtain that if you were not carefull flooded the whole room also our room was in the basement ,0
2617, Smallest room I ve seen in a long time I booked a double deluxe room and it appeared to be one of the smallest rooms looking at the fire escape floor plan Far from impressed ,0
2618, Our room was in some sort of basement therefore the view was rather disappointing The window showed some kind of patio where the hotel staff walked through to get to the other rooms We had to keep the curtains closed for privacy this was not a really big issue ,0
2619, So called deluxe double room is claustrophobic It is overpriced but what isn t in London In addition on the web site breakfast was included in reality it s not ,0
2620, I was very dissapointed with this property our daughter booked and paid for this as a birthday present we had hassle checking in the receptionist wanted a copy of the card for security as this wasnt our card we didnt have it we offered our own card to use and they wanted to refund our daughters card which would take 10 days and take the money for the room from us there was no reason to do this and was a bad start to our trip Also the pictures are very misleading the rooms were tiny I wouldnt return here but would definitely return to the area,0
2621,No Negative,0
2622,No Negative,0
2623, Rooms are much smaller than they look in website Booked a double room for a couple up on check in into room found only one set of things in the room one towel one coffee cup etc Two calls to reception with 20 min wait to get things sorted ,0
2624, A bath in the suite is the only thing that would have made it better The hotel was further from Paddington than we d expected,0
2625, Unfortunately the room was too hot to sleep and the air conditioning could not cope with the heat ,0
2626, There are two of the same franchise in the same street so watch out for that this is the one at the corner of Queens Gardens,0
2627, Room too small with tiniest bathroom Very lengthy check in procedure which involved taking photocopies of my id and credit card For security and other reasons I was not happy about this and it doesn t happen at other hotels ,0
2628, Bit strange being asked for photo ID to check in I hadn t seen that when booking and just by luck I had my driving licence with me ,0
2629, Room very nice but unfortunately the bed was quite dirty I know this is not the standard of this hotel but I had this unpleasant surprise on my last staying I m sure it won t happen again ,0
2630, No milk in room and called to say late check in and told at check in that my booking was about to be cancelled if any later ,0
2631, Breakfast was poor and uninspiring with limited selection wouldn t bother with it next time Also more expensive to buy it on booking com than at the hotel,0
2632, The only down side to the hotel is the beds and pillows First the pillows are like bricks I recommend taking your own pillow if you have to you wake up with sore red ears off them Also the beds are not too comfy could be better I didn t want to think what our room would of been like without the free upgrade But overall for the price I paid which was 153 it wasn t bad as that included breakfast for 2 You can pay a lot more in London for the same service ,0
2633, This particular hotel has a chain of 3 buildings all in close proximity to each so was not sure if hotel we stayed in was one advertised Also room given to us was on ground floor and curtains covered what was the old main entrance to building no double glazing so extremely noisey,0
2634, There was no hot water in the hotel so they moved us to another sister hotel down the road This hotel had tiny rooms noisy setup itchy sheets and in the middle of night a couple walked in on me as the reception gave them a key to my room Didn t sleep well Will not stay again,0
2635, second time i ve visited this hotel First time my husband and i were bumped This time when told they were moving me i stood my ground and insisted they gave me the room i d booked Don t trust them no consideration for woman travelling alone You can imagine my shook and horror as 2 gentlemen came to check in next to me and were given rooms without hesitation or treat o f being moved My checking in experience was so upsetting i did not bother asking for help when my rooms heating wasn t working So I froze all night didn t sleep and felt totally upset when asked on checking out if i d had a good stay i said no and explained why Oh sorry to hear that Bye was the response i recieved from the polite but obviously not empowered reception staff Beware of the dubious checking in policy ,0
2636, Disappointed that the front desk could not accept a franked letter for posting One front desk person sent me to post box at Paddington while the next day I was directed to a post box just down the street A seemingly insignificant thing but not when one is a visitor to a foreign land ,0
2637, We booked this through a third party booking Com Previously to that I had spoken to reservations of shatsbury hotels which indicated to me you have made a perfect choice for the location and purpose of your special occasion surprise to your partners birthday They also stated this is a wonderful boutique hotel and which would meet your needs for this occasion The lady also stated you can book through our selves or the third party If you decided you wish to book through us you will be offered breakfast included in the price How ever I decided to book through third part as the price was a better rate for our selves I had been in contact with the hotel manager and discussed possible arrangements and touches for my partners surprise On arrival all seemed okay had a coffee in bar why waiting for room to be handed over When entering the junior suite room I was astounded in how poor quality and damage of furnishings also dust and extremely cold as well as the cold feel to the room I unfortunately broke down to my partner and had to apologise I had been let down We then went down to reception and spoke with the manager Sophia and explained our concerns of the room Sophia said I can show you another room but it will be smaller and same quality as we re currently going a new refurbishment as of last week I explained I wish I had been told this before How ever Sophia said I will get you moved to the hotel you stayed at before which is Kensington park grande She spoke to reservations to find out and sort out Thinking everything was under full control sadly it turned in to a disaster of a night mare I then took things in to my control by phoning reservations cut the long story short 2 hrs later still got know where really and by now my partner is currently not good health due to waiting for brain surgery has now got stressed and feeling dizzy and sick We went down to reception and finally the gm Natish took us in to club lounge and spoke to us ,0
2638, The air conditioner seems not to work because although I adjust it to 32 degrees but actually I felt less than 20 degrees and it was cold during night Also I booked for a double bed but initially it was 2 single beds next to each other Once I asked for a double bed they just put something like mattress protector to cover the gap between the 2 single mattresses ,0
2639, I was dissatisfied with the fact that the shower floor was not sectioned off from the main bathroom floor There was no difference between the shower floor and bathroom floor so to speak ,0
2640, Poor room service staff reception should be much more pleasant disappointed of their welcome guys try to smile even if the client can t speak english well Room service worst one ever Changing bed and putting same dirty pillows Come on that s not a good service for london,0
2641, This hotel is supposed to be a 4 accommodation However given our experience it can be said it s no more than 2 We booked a deluxe twin room with 2 twin beds When we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed We told the front desk about this They reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds They also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct We were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back First they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other Park hotels When we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this So we had to accept the room anyhow They also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day More interestingly we made the booking in Euros and were charged more than 20 Euros more than our initial booking without any explanation When we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work The heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature Remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet When we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working OK and that we would have to wait to heat up That did not happen the room was only getting colder because the blower just blew cold air Mid januari in London that is not nice We called again and finally somebody came and said there was indeed a malfunction However they told us not being able to repair it until next day ,0
2642, Poor level of cleanliness in my room particularly around the bed and in the frame area of the bed Cooked breakfast was also half cold and not very good ,0
2643,No Negative,0
2644, When we got there they told us no room left and try to send us to another unknown hotel and also asking pay first Even tho we book one week ago there s no advance notice or apology explaination I basically stood next to the front desk and watch people check out so eventually got a room With tinny window and on the grand floor hearing people walk passing by ,0
2645, We were told at 9pm to keep quiet which was annoying as it was still early and then we got told we could use the club lounge and two minutes later got asked to go back to our room it was just annoying but I wouldn t say it s a place to go with a group of friends if you are planning a night out as it didn t suit us even when being quiet ,0
2646, Room bed was a bit worn and windows allowed some street noise in so sleeping in was not really an option,0

2659, Very compact room Dark decor made room appear smaller Location of hair dryer strange ,0
2660, There was a double and single bed in our room for 3 adults There were no rooms with three single beds so two of my friends had to share which was uncomfortable for them ,0
2661, The room was uncomfortably small When showering the water came through the bathroom door and got the carpet wet causing a bad smell,0
2662, Air conditioning wasn t great Where the hairdryer was situated in our room was convenient for the mirror You had to perch at the top of the bed to dry your hair as you couldn t detach the hairdryer to move it to a more convenient plug The mirror pulled out an angle to the bed The mattress was 2 smaller ones pushed together and this meant there was more bed stead than mattress and you found yourself walking into the sides of the bed all the time The shower door only opened half way which meant you had to manoeuvre between that and the towel rail on the right hand side which didn t leave much room Whilst the style of the room was very nice the dark wood was very dark Didn t like the fact I had to hand over photo ID and the Receptionist was unable to answer why when I asked only that it was hotel policy which is fine but why She took my credit card to confirm I was the one that made the booking my partner wasn t asked to show any ID and what if I didn t have ID would I not be allowed to check in despite me having pre paid the room Not happy about this information being available hence why I requested the copy back on departure Small Bar facilities at the hotel with very limited choice of draught beverages ,0
2663, At first the room that was given to us was not the luxury double that was booked It was a very small room But the staff kindly moved us into a bigger room and apologised for the inconvenience ,0
2664,No Negative,0
2665, The second room for our family was not as close as we would have liked despite requesting rooms together Staff were perfunctory and showed no interest whatsoever in us or in enhancing our stay in London When asked to call a taxi they arranged an Uber car and the driver did not know how to get to the destination a tube station so my husband had to use his own phone to navigate Expensive for what we got ,0
2666, My partner dropped a new earring in the bathroom sink and it could apparently not be retrieved without a plumber This would have cost us more than it was worth so it stayed in the u bend I believe it could have been accessed without much difficulty using a Phillips screwdriver but who carries one ,0
2667,No Negative,0
2668, Nothing,0
2669, The staff wasn t friendly when I was checking in She didn t even smile After that someone else was given the same room as us after we checked in Then we cannot get into our room with the key ,0
2670, The fact that we were transfered to another building 5 minutes away because of maintenance issues The room and bathroom are very small in size The shower box is literally the size of a single cupboard ,0
2671, The evening receptionist Desmond on the night of the 8th to the 9th of December handled a situation very badly when his colleagues earlier on in the day had given us permission to use the lounge room until pick up by shuttle to the airport at 4am he came to inform us that we could not stay in the hotel unless we book a room He apologized after upsetting us but it was a bit too late ,0

2673, I stayed twice so far each time in the standard double room Once was in an attic and that room was a lot more tight for space than the other Both fairly usually small for an inner city hotel room The Attic room lights were bright with no lamp but the other room had better mood lighting ,0

2677, Too far from City central if you didn t know you have to have an Oyster card for buses and your friend won t go on the tube No plug socket near a mirror ,0
2678, I didnt like the way a staff member handled my cancellation of one night as I had to cut my trip short because of a death in the family Trainees should be taught to escalate more sensitive matters if they are not equipped to handle them ,0
2679, triple room is small Not enough space for big luggages You have to squeeze in to fit and not enough variety of food in the breakfast lounge,0
2680, The first night I was booked to a tiny double bedroom 033 on the ground floor and unfortunately you could hear all night cars driving and pedestrians walking by Also the room wasn t very good isolated and you could see the light from the corridor outside and the corridor door opening and shut Also the housekeeping team must have had nearby their cleaning cupboards so from 07 00am you heard loud voices and the vacuum cleaner going on The bathroom in this room was designed for a disabled wheel chair person which is ok but I felt it was a bit small and the shower was not warming up and the water pressures was low so it took ages to wash off soap etc however after i complained to the front staff about the noise and the water they put me in one of their club rooms which was better and the water pressure in the shower was good Overall I stayed in the hotel for three nights and it was a good experience,0
2681,No Negative,0
2682, Letter of complaint already written Small room with nowhere to work No shower as such just a wet room and you could not open bathroom door to get in there,0
2683, Nothing except the fact that room service is closing at 12am ,0
2684, It s true that they give booking com customers the worst rooms right by reception The bathroom was tiny not enough plug sockets and the shower wouldn t stop dripping The room was also freezing and had to ask for a heater ,0
2685, The rooms are very small and also booking com is VERY misleading the room did not have all of the listed items in the room the room was spose to be a deluxe but was more like a standard very disappointing and very misleading description of the room from booking com,0
2686, The only thing missing was there was no bath only a shower but it was a great shower The rooms were a little too cosey small ,0
2687, Breakfast was disappointing would of been upset if I had to pay for it,0
2688,No Negative,0
2689, The rooms were extremely small and overpriced We asked to be moved from the first room as it was in the basement off the main corridor and what felt like a storage area Very disappointed for the price being charged The second room was an improvement however still very small ,0
2690, The room I was saying was directly under the stairs and I could hear every footstep I didn t sleep very well as there was a constant disturbance I would suggest insulating that particular room to prevent the noise thudding through ,0
2691, at my arrival I didn t find the room even if the late arrival was written they just offer me a taxi for another hotel but I had to look for it they didn t suggest me anything ,0
2692, The rooms are very very small we only had 2 small suitcases and there was no room for them The breakfast isn t great we were given it complementary but would have been very disappointed if I d paid for it ,0
2693, absolutely noisy air condition they booked a deposit of one night that has not been resolved again upon payment mini bathroom not possible to shower without getting everything wet no wardrobe at all,0
2694, Dreadful staff who would not help despite their booking process being unclear They need the card you book the room under to be present at check in which is useless for corporate bookings They will not take card payment over the phone or web because of fraud but would be happy to take a payment from the same card if you didn t turn up Happy to leave two guests waiting in reception with no access to room whilst this was resolved Really bad experience won t be booking again They also want to photocopy your driving license and bank card and try to tell you that you have to sign up to their loyalty club ,0
2695, Stairs our room is located between the ground and the 1st floor so no direct lift access We had to carry our big suitcases from stairs Gladly the hotel staffs were really helpful with our luggages The room was a bit narrow but perfectly acceptable given the price and being in London ,0
2696,No Negative,0
2697, No thing good on this hotel Very small rooms we booked for room 14 m2 it was less of 8 m2 This not hotel but like one store of animals ,0
2698, Small Very small room ,0
2699, We felt the location was a bit far out from the main attractions however the price of the room was very reasonable which compensated for the taxi fares ,0
2700, The heater didn t work in the room called reception 4 times nothing done about it The toilet was also blocked in our room called reception to be told there WA no one that could help us until tomorrow morning so had to use the toilets in the hallway ,0
2701, not hotels fault but noise from idiots driving around cars middle of night with loud car exhausts,0
2702, That their system couldn t heat the room and I had to use a heater ,0
2703, The double room I was in was extremely small The bathroom was as well There is no possible way that more than one person could possibly stay in that room Now I was there for business and I literally just slept showered and dressed there so there was no real issue but just understand what you are getting ,0
2704, Everything were good only the bathroom is to small and the shower water doesn t go to the drainage straight away so it is wet everywhere and the cupboard is not functional hard to reach ,0
2705, I did not the like the reception staff as when there was a problem the resented the fact that there was one ,0
2706, Bathing cubicle does not have sliding door Hence we had to request for extra floor mat to prevent flooding ,0
2707, The rooms were small and the bathroom was a wet room which wasn t great especially as it was unexpected Also not entirely sure we were given the deluxe double room we paid for ,0
2708, Uuufhh Where do I even start The rooms have no space you feel confined in them You can hear the person next door through the walls The hotel is a long walk from the nearest station The housekeeping lady kept coming into my room without knocking on my door she came 4 times between 11 and 12 noon her excuse she wanted to clean the room even though I told her not come in again The hotel should be 2 star and I don t know how they were rated 4 star Perhaps it is self acclaimed I wouldn t advise anyone to go there you ll regret it and wish you hadn t A word they say is enough for the wise but these are alot of words ,0
2709, Look at the curtains looks like blood stains all over even though it may be chemicals I hope Also you pulled money ahead of time which I wasnt informed of as it stood that the full amount would be paid at the property ,0
2710, The first night we were allocated a basement room found this claustrophobic The staff who were excellent throughout moved us on the second night to a much better room on level3,0
2711, Lovely bedroom but no space to walk round my bed ,0
2712, Steps leading from pavement to Reception were awkward for a pushchair Price of the breakfast Lots of cafes within 5 minutes walking distance charging only 5 6 for a full English breakfast ,0
2713, Room was not as described it was tiny in basement looked out to old ladders dirty curtains Shower flooded floor soaking hazardous wet all round wc and whb this was not a deluxe room Diningroom very pokey claustrophobic,0
2714,No Negative,0
2715,No Negative,0
2716, The room was small and gloomy with dark panelling and inconvenient lighting It looked out into a tiny well and was badly overlooked by another room so I had to keep the curtains closed more gloom I assume I was given the room because I was travelling alone but I booked for 2 people and I was paying the same as 2 people I don t appreciate being treated as a 2nd class citizen ,0
2717,No Negative,0
2718, May be the Restaurant Bar must extend the close hours ,0
2719,No Negative,0
2720, The double deluxe room was not like the picture it s very small and I felt like I was in a prison cell when I complained the staff did their best to upgrade me to a bigger room however I did feel like it was false advertising to begin with we requested one of the rooms to have 2 single beds they called this a twin room and made us pay 50 more for 2 nights however it was still a double bed or as they call it 2 single beds on one base not sure what the point of that is ,0
2721,No Negative,0
2722, Got to the hotel we booked and needed to be moved elsewhere We were not happy with the hotel we were moved to as a group and this review reflects that hotel the Montcalm ,0
2723, The location is far away in terms of walking to marble arch oxford and regent street There is a hotel almost have the same name with one word different in the end of the road which makes the taxis some times lost and confused Not enough electric socket and not close to bed for phone charging The room is too small comparing to other hotels with the same class Not recommended to families due to small rooms Check there official website before book via booking com as some times you will find it cheaper and comes with breakfast ,0
2724, We had a problem at reception when we arrived which was never resolved to our satisfaction ,0
2725, Room was tiny marginally bigger than the bed and more importantly there was no where to put anything be it my bag or even just a hair brush The bathroom is what is euphemistically known as a wet room meaning everything gets soaked when you have a shower You therefore have to plan your morning routine carefully unless you don t mind cleaning your teeth while standing in a puddle ,0
2726, The bathroom If it can be called that even Honestly it is just a cubicle with no demarcation for the shower just a shower curtain that you pull across but that certainly does not help as for sure there is water everywhere on the floor when you shower We had to put down 3 towels to soak it all up as it s a mess they could surely have increased the size by cutting down on the seating area of the room It was really very tiny though we were in the Club Room ,0
2727, I didn t like that it took 2 other bad experiences in Paddington before we found this one ,0
2728, I was setting in the Reception Reception staff they are not respecting the customer they are saying to some customer at 2 clock you can get the key and other giving them the key When I spoke to her she said we have categories I told her I know you have categories when first customer came I kept quite because they are 2 but when you allow for other single customer to get the key that mean there is no management and no respect for customer and that not fair she didn t give me any answer just said wait 15 min it will reach 2 and you will get the key after 5 min asking me to get the they how she arranged they faster The reception is the front of the hotel if the employee s behavior is abusive the owner will be looses My evidence hotel camera ,0
2729, An unpleasant smell in bathrooms due to style of plumbing and in some rooms wet room means that bathroom floor can be rather wet ,0
2730, Very big problems with payment by bank transfer Problems with extension our stay at hotel Shame because hotel is ok ,0
2731, The wardrobe and the hair dryer were a slightly inconvenient to use But it s manageable for a few days stay ,0
2732, Incorrect payment my credit card was charged twice first time on the arrival send time when we leave When I found this I tried to get my money back It is already almost 20 days 5 emails written and still did not get my money back Never go there again ,0
2733, got a basement room with no natural light Tiny room tiny wadrobe inside a wall and they could do smth with unused space from the entrance to the room ,0

2735, There was nothing to complain about ,0
2736, Toilet seat had hair on it the two rooms were not very close together and they were rather cramped ,0
2737, The room was tiny To put this into perspective we are two 30 yr old females who have travelled quite a bit and have used various standards of accomadation from hostels upwards so it s not like we re accustomed to luxury I ve also been in London a number of times so I understand hotel rooms are small in general Knowing this we paid a bit extra for a deluxe double as it was supposed to have more room but the bed was a standard double in size and there was only bare walking room on one side and at the end and you could just about stand on the other side of it We actually found it massively amusing trying to figure out what was deluxe about the room ,0
2738, We had to change rooms as the ac did not work and they did not fix it Staff could hardly understand English and I thought I was in London but English is not the language ,0
2739, Reception staff very poor service not friendly not helpful I feel we got fooled with a few things only because the staff in the reception didn t inform us about things like if you prebook your breakfast at the reception the day before is only 9 not more as we got charged when we went down in the restaurant if you ask them to call you a cab they call you a private kind of a chauffeur service which is more expensive then the usual London cabs etc We booked a room for 3 people in a small room there was a double bed and a very uncomfortable sofa one of us had to sleep on that on the sofa Also had a few issues with the charges on my credit card in the hotel they were not helpful they didn t give me any explanation they gave me an email to email them I wouldn t trust them again with my credit card ,0
2740, Wish the rooms were a bit bigger We booked a triple room They gave us the one facing the back of the hotel which was very claustrophobic It was so bad we were going to leave the hotel but then they showed us their other triple room which faces the front street of the hotel and that was much better But generally very claustrophobic rooms My teenage kids didn t like it as they need their space ,0
2741, The room was too small bathroom sink was clogged and electrical sockets did not work so I could not charge by mobile phone I changed my hotel to Grand Park Court around the block ,0
2742,No Negative,0

2745, Terrible Gym Kitchen people smoking right outside this tiny Gym with windows open into gym and terrible smell of cigarette Very expensive for what you get and also not on par with other 4 stars ,0
2746, had to ask for complimentary items that should have been included in our room hairdryer situation was poor couldn t see in a mirror without being a contortionist no explanation of facilities and their location,0
2747, Extremely small rooms though not surprising for Central London you can barely move within the ground floor rooms Either misleading pictures on booking com or the hotel gave us their smallest rooms knowing we re travelling with children ,0
2748, 1 The steep steps leading to my room 2 THe lack of a cloth to cover the bread stick as you cut it thus your hand and anyonelses was placed on the end of the bread to steady it as you cut ,0
2749, Upon check in I was asked to move to a sister property Apparently my room was under rennivation the sister property room was a shoebox size They miraculously found a room for me at the first hotel and the room was extremely small Incredibly dirty I will not be back I checked out after one night and paid a penalty fee I will not be back ,0
2750, I booked a double deluxe room here online but when I got there they gave me a small room the size of a closet because it was available first even though I had paid the price point for a double deluxe room 450 pounds a night They then transferred me to a slightly bigger room that still wasn t a double deluxe and looked nothing like in the pictures Staff were rude and reluctant to help whenever spoken to and at one point in the lounge area we witnessed one of the staff giving a young hotel guest a loud and stern lecture about payment the whole exchange was very uncomfortable and unprofessional For 450 pounds night 800 Canadian dollars we would have gotten a spacious room in other countries with wonderful service but here I felt like I had thrown a bunch of money down the drain ,0
2751,No Negative,0
2752, They changed us two times from one hotel to another when we arrived They offered us complimentary breakfast The drawback is that the bathroom was very small and it smells bad sometimes ,0
2753, Deluxe double was a small room Interior was back to the 70s TV was small and hardly viewable Front line staff were great but the managers appeared as honest as Arthur Daley No room for luggage Bathroom too small,0
2754, Reception was a nightmare When we arrived they put into a room which NOT what we ordered and they were more concerned with taking our money than providing a service Treated us like B grade guests because we had booked using Booking com We asked them to book a taxi for us on departure and they booked a cab for the wrong time Would not stay there again ,0
2755, The room and bathroom shower was very small and quite claustrophobic ,0
2756, rooms are slightly small so if you have a big luggage hard to move and no space to unpack some of the stuff had an attitude i had a big window in the room but looking to back side of the street so no nice view ,0
2757, The room was a Club It was ridiculously small in that it was a struggle to walk round the end of the bed Anyone more than 6ft 3 tall would be struggling with the low ceiling height The bathroom was a toilet basin with a shower which had a curtain ridiculously small it is not a wet room The mattress dipped in the middle so an uncomfortable 2 nights sleep Overall we felt that we had been charged a lot more than it was worth As a regular genius booker with booking com we ware disappointed not to have been alerted to these problems as we would have stayed elsewhere ,0
2758, We had asked for a nice room as we were celebrating our 6 month wedding anniversary but we were given a room down in basement level which obviously meant no view Then the bed consisted of two single mattresses pushed together on a wooden base which was far too big for purpose The room was smaller than we expected to get for the 436 we paid for the two nights Also the shower tray is pretty much on the same level as the bathroom floor so if you re in the shower any longer than a couple of minutes the bathroom floor gets totally flooded All in all definitely not worth the money we paid ,0
2759, Unfortunately there was not enough storage space in our room One small hanging space and two small bedside drawers is not enough for a stay of three nights It meant that we were not even able to partially unpack our cases I would have liked more space for our personal toiletries in the bathroom as well ,0
2760, NOT the room type we ordered and paid for Two very single mattress made up individually on a king size wooden bed base does not equal a double bed Room was nice but not in our opinion a deluxe ,0
2761, Rooms are too small not enough or to be correct almost no wardrobe space and a useless entry space without even a few hooks that area could be used at least to hang your coat hat or a few stuff,0
2762, A room with a broken and leaking shower should not be given to guests Neither the reservation system nor the receptionists do understand that a female guest s family name can consist of two parts like maiden name plus husband s name while the respective husband has just one name This lead to the problem that an important parcel has not been accepted for which my husband was eagerly waiting Instead it was sent back by the receptionist ,0
2763,No Negative,0
2764, Despite 21 days ill health notice the hotel would not consider changing our reservation to another date and our full nights accommodation was forfeited,0
2765, nothing,0

2767, Small room and the slow inprofessional response from the staff for the room A c problem despite complaining three times about it which took them two nights to move me for another room with a properly working A C unit ,0
2768, The toilet was very small On the day we checked in the walk in price was less than what we paid on booking com I would definitely call the hotel to check the price before booking ,0
2769, The room was awful Too small very claustrophobic awful view,0
2770, Rooms were not as advertised Although clean and well maintained rooms were a bit run down Rooms were very small for the price Hardly room to dwing a cat Management were not responsive to requests for change Had the feeling of being conned ,0

2772,No Negative,0
2773, We had arranged to have a continental breakfast my husband changed his mind When checking out the manager charged us the difference for 3 people having a full English breakfast When challenged and asked for a receipt the manager rudely passed threw the receipt to my husband My husband asked he why he did it and was ignored A sad ending to an otherwise very enjoyable stay ,0
2774, The size of the room is definitely smaller than the description Befor arriving they informed us that the room we booked had something wrong so they will transfer us to their sister hotel which is two minutes walk We rejected and the first night they arranged us to a room at basement floor which was horriable I think it is because of overbook The hotel is not very clean And at the 7th day the toilet flush button also didn t work well ,0
2775, The room we had was in basement so no phone signal which was a pain,0
2776, The walk in shower as the floor was always flooded ,0
2777, There was absolutely no insolation between the room and corridor I was woken constantly through the night especially with people coming back in the early hours of the morning and arguing for several hours I travel extensively and this is the worst hotel I ve stayed at due to the noise factor ,0
2778, The experience was very bad staff unprofessional especially the reception Bad Bad Bad room service This hotel dont deserve to be 4 stars at all max 2 5 stars ,0
2779, The bathroom was ridiculous There was no tub or shower door just a curtain and a drain in the middle of the floor so when you showered water soaked the entire bathroom floor surface ,0
2780, Initially we were provided with two very poor rooms Neither had curtains only blinds which did not close properly The compact room was extremely small and had a musty smell The deluxe double could in no way be described as deluxe Among other things the carpet at the entrance of the shower room was very wet ,0
2781, The rooms were incredibly small and cramped We struggled to even get through the door to our room The rooms were not clean there were very big brown stains on the carpet The hotel is dated and the fixtures including the thermostat were falling off the wall in some cases ,0

3778,No Negative,0
3779, Not only did the staff on arrival ask to copy the details of my credit card this is OK but they also noted down the CVV number from the back of the credit card This means that the hotel has all the information to use my credit card for internet purchases Since this is unacceptable I asked the receptionist to delete the CVV but she refused This policy should be changed Otherwise good hotel ,0
3780, N A,0
3781, The sauna is a wonderfull addition it s a shame I had to slalom in the cleaning staff halway almost filled with cleaning products Also the proximity to the cleaning staff s room added all the noise to what was supposed to be a quiet moment maybe it would be a good idea to relocate their general quarter ,0

3787, Nothing to declare ,0
3788, No gym as its being refurbed which was not clear on the site apart from right at the bottom Also I was not allowed to then change hotel after I discovered this when i brought it up with the staff in the morning who were a little short I was then emailed far to late saying I could change but by that time I was already at work Also you changed the price of the booking the second night to add insult because of demand which apparently was on the site too Absolute joke how you can get away with that ,0
3789,No Negative,0
3790, the rooms are small but hey it s Paris,0
3791, Due to the tightness of parking you re requested to leave car keys with reception so they can move cars if necessary I was blocked in as the owners didn t leave their car key though the manager did manage to get round this The sound proofing wasn t great as I could hear the people above me talking non stop from 7am ,0
3792, Could improve on breakfast items grapefruit juice was not fresh anymore scrambled eggs not enough cooked ,0

3813, The hotel is situated in the worst area of Paris as the black cab driver i used from outside the station informed me as he charged me five times the going rate for dropping me there The Kube hotel is situated up a dirty side round with timber boarding across the front in the day and 3 4 doorman in the evening The ice bar in the hotel looks nothing like the advert on their website ,0
3814, Location not far from Gard de Nord otherwise somewhat out of the way until we found our way around the Metro which was good Breakfast not impressive little choice coffee not hot Bar had limited opening times closed early so no customers no atmosphere D cor seating was good so if the management put some effort into it would do a lot better Ice Bar was a great novelty but at 18C we didn t fancy it perhaps next time we will brave it Also a kettle in the room would be helpful ,0
3815, The showers in the rooms are awful not enclosed with just a tap extension on the wall which is too low and the water sprays everywhere,0
3816, The location wasn t the best but it was real close to the metro which got you anywhere you wanted in minutes So it wasn t so bad ,0
3817, Limited food available from the reception bar ,0
3818, Booking com advertised my room as having a bath however it didn t The TV didn t work meaning the wifi didn t work Advised staff of both issues and received no offer of resolution Acted as though because it was a last minute booking due to Eurostar cancellation that it was my problem and I should just make do Very sub standard,0
3819, Worst hotel ever Awful location bar and restaurant closed all 3 days we were there Non existent receptionists and TV reception was variable Had junior suite but no robes no proper shower either ,0
3820, No proper light over bathroom mirror Bathroom open to room Nightclub feel to corridors Floor in foyer worn and didn t appear clean breakfast was set up there and with the black decor was not very inviting we took our breakfast out into the courtyard The breakfast buffet was okay but the cheese was in a container which had previously been used for a fish buffet a whiff of old seafood at breakfast The corridors walls were covered with a black fake fur ,0
3821, I didn t feel very comfortable around the area and the fact you could hear people outside the room most of the night as well was not the best ,0
3822, Very bad experience as I lost more than 700 euros It was stolen from my bag I just knew when I arrived back ,0
3823, Toilet not clean on arrival no shower curtain shower fixture loose bad smell in room ,0
3824, very bad area in the station neighborhood staff couldn t speak English so it was extremely difficult to communicate lack of communication among staff which forced me to repeat things to each member of staff it took me 1 hr to check out ,0
3825, We didn t have a bad experience but the location seems a little unsafe at night WLking in the day is fine but I would be more inclined to take a taxi at night There were a lot of youths and homeless out drinking This is unfortunately out of the hands of the hotel ,0
3826, Fitness club was out of order which was the only reason I booked this particular hotel for the price The staff were vague about the situation and it never got fixed during our 5 day stay And there are no parks nearby for running There were some strangely quirky aspects to the room layour that didn t make sense like a shower with no door or curtain which left an inch of water on the bathroom carpet There was no drain in the floor and all of this meant we could only take baths all week ,0
3827, the noise and the neighbourhood,0
3828, First day cold water and no breakfast Localization very bad on a dangerous zone ,0
3829, Gym,0

3837, Under going renovation which I wasn t made aware of room comfortable but tired ,0
3838, Place is really old cramped and dirty even dirtier than London in general There was a smell in the room I was initially put into and another smell in another room I asked for ,0
3839, 1 The hotel was redecorating it was not like the pictures shows it can be barely recognized 2 It was a long way from elevator to my room lots of doors just imagine you are carrying one or two suitcases and you still have to open the doors again and again when you walking through a very long way besides nobody is intending to help you terrible experience 3 The in room breakfast was not on time I was almost late on the morning 4 Very old decorations not clean enough 5 It was definitely not worth for the price ,0

3841,No Negative,0
3842, We had no complaints whatsoever ,0
3843, Double room was small and in need of a freshen up Also woken up a 5am when a noisy generator fired up outside our room this may have something to do with all the building work that is going on at the hotel but when you have had a late night that s the last thing you want ,0
3844,No Negative,0
3845, Sink in bathroom extremely small We were asked for our champagne to room and didnt appear so had to get on check out Also found it very disappointing to be asked to pay for room service on the spot and not able to put on room bill we were very offended by this we have stayed in hotels all over the world and never been asked to do this before In fact had returned from a wonderful holiday in Hong Kong just the week before and had room service and paid on check out Would appreciate some feed back on this matter,0
3846, Nothing at all ,0
3847, I have stayed at the hotel at least half a dozen times over the past three years The rooms are getting tired and worn The front desk staff are indifferent I tried to break a 50 note at front desk so I could tip the waitress in dining room at breakfast they told me to do it myself at one of the nearby restaurants Major exterior renos going on outside hotel I hope they are going to upgrade the rooms as well I think it is time that I try another hotel ,0

3850, Had to go to local shop for fresh milk as not available from housekeeping staff One awful sandwich in the bar Shame really as other food very good ,0
3851, The first room we were allocated had a musty smell to it but we were efficiently moved across to another room with no bother at all Some areas need updating but this was already underway in some parts of the hotel Shower was very noisy ,0
3852, I had requested a quiet room Given room on the 6th floor air conditioning not cooling room but extremely noisy room very hot Blocked bath drain shower faulty water filling the bath from the bath tap while shower on Requested room change Given Room on 2nd floor Windows blocked out no daylight Extreme noise from continual external exhaust fans between 5am until 11pm Worst sleep ever Old noisy air conditioning system also Hotel undergoing major building works not advised of this When booking I booked for 3 nights and wanted to cancel the last night to go elsewhere but hotel unable to advise about cancellation as I had made the booking through Booking com ,0
3853, The bed was huge plenty of room but the mattress was extremely hard and slightly bowed Both my husband I had an uncomfortable nights sleep woke in the morning with aching backs which was a first for both of us ,0
3854, see adjacent box ,0
3855, ,0
3856, The room was a bit small but that s a function of the hotel maintaining the Victorian style we liked Work on the hotel was in progress while we were there so the machine sounds in the lobby were deafening at times ,0

3858, Room and hotel generally were a little dark Pillow was lumpy Decor and furniture a little tired ,0
3859, Seems like room would be very hot in summer Air conditioning did not cool room very much when I used it but not a real issue in June ,0
3860, The rooms are dingy and in serious need of an upgrade with chipped furniture and old fittings ,0
3861, The hotel was being renovated which gave it a slightly run down appearance The sink in our room was cracked and there was no hair conditioner available in the hotel The television was very small and dated ,0
3862, N A,0
3863, We had a small claustrophobic room next to the noisy road with a questionable air con system and the shower did not work An engineer failed to repair it and after several cold showers we were moved to a new quieter and better room the next day and were compensated for the inconvenience ,0
3864,No Negative,0
3865, Shower was a bit different to work taps slightly broken and the tap you pull up was broken ,0
3866, We chose that hotel because of its locations but the room was an interior one and the view was awful which was very disappointing Interior rooms shouldn t cost the same money The Windows weren t closing and some parts need refurbishment ,0
3867, After checking out I left my luggage at the concierge However when I returned I had to wait or over 20 minutes before I got my items as the concierge was elsewhere This resulted in me nearly missing my train ,0
3868, Hotel has clearly done a deal with golden tours bus tours we asked the concierge if he could recommend us a good bus tour he sold us tickets for the golden tours busses The tour was abysmal and not worth the time or money we spent on it Breakfast was poor just a buffet food was a bit cold luckily we hadn t had to pay for breakfast bc the hotel had made a mistake with our room so they gave us free breakfast in return but if we had paid I d have been complaining about the breakfast to the staff in charge ,0
3869, There was no water in the room and we had to pay 10 for two bottles from the bar ,0
3870, We couldn t shower bath the cold tap fell off bathroom very cramped would be better off with just a shower in there Breakfast was awful dried up bacon mushrooms eggs weren t any better Drinks very expensive We did complain and were given a refund,0
3871, The air conditioning was pretty useless and didn t cool down the room as it was located on the floor and not on the ceiling and it was very warm in the room ,0
3872, They charge a fortune for breakfast use the caf s surrounding the park instead Cheaper and nicer For working not very good comfort The desk and chair in the room is very uncomfortable to sit and work with ,0
3873, Rooms and bathrooms larger and better air conditioning ,0
3874, Breakfast was horribly overpriced We were offered option for reduced rate of we bought breakfast every morn of our visit but we couldn t do this because we had to leave early the day we departed ,0
3875, The fire drill that takes place every Monday at 1 00 pm After a transatlantic flight we were asleep when the alarm went off ,0

3878,No Negative,0
3879, The bed was extremely uncomfortable The mattress is very soft to the point where if you aren t sleeping in the middle of the bed you might fall off of it I woke up with back pains as well We ended up switching hotels because of it There was no dresser to put your clothes in which was also kind of a bummer Other than that the hotel is old so if you like something modern it s not that Personally that didn t really bother me ,0
3880, Not unique to The Russell but I dislike being charged a discretionary service charge of 12 5 and also asked to leave a gratuity on the bill ,0
3881, Rooms very tired and badly in need of refurbishment Air conditioning did not work Bathroom very small Lifts very small ,0
3882, The shower didn t work properly The bathroom was tiny and it wasn t easy to get out of the shower A shower cap would have come in useful ,0

3889,No Negative,0
3890, Some of us found the frequent sirens of ambulances heading for the nearby Great Ormond Street Hospital disturbing in the nighttime ,0
3891, No shower cap shower gel or conditioner Insufficient milk and coffee Air conditioning so noisy that it was unusable Fridge not working Food in restaurant very average quality Drinks very expensive Threadbare carpet on stairs ,0
3892, Friendly concierges were helpful but weren t actually familiar with many of the sites or transports inquired after They went online to find out ,0
3893, Nothing It was a lovely but small room in London with a good view But had everything we needed Would definitely stay again ,0
3894, Building is old and has a very small lift however great staircase ,0
3895, More choice for room service both food and drink to suit todays traveller More TV film choices as currently limited ,0
3896, The Hotel Russell is one of our favourite London hotels but our room this visit was quite small and there was no view at all from the window BUT it was very good value we booked quite late and it was a busy weekend ,0
3897, Got a room over the hallway from major refurbishment that woke us up in the morning Got the room changed with very little fuss ,0
3898, the pillow too big for me therefore my nights were uncomfotable i was obliged to use the red decorative cushion ,0
3899, It s a tired old building We had problems with plumbing A C didn t work elevator is so tiny two people plus luggage fill it up Windows didn t open There is no business center to print airline tickets Overall it was expensive and there are other choices nearby at the same or lower cost ,0
3900,No Negative,0
3901, We spend 5 nights in three different rooms We were moved twice due to very very poor Quality rooms This is a lovely looking hotel from the street with marvellous staff and a great position but a hotel that is well over due for a complete makeover I would suggest for the price to stay at the Russell you could do MUCH better elsewhere,0
3902,No Negative,0
3903, The room 427 was not up to the standards of a 2016 4 star hotel Mattress too hard Not enough wardrobe space noisy Bathroom would have been ok in 1975 ,0
3904, Air conditioning unit didn t work and it was a hot night on Saturday with quite thick duvets on the bed Also the bathroom was VERY compact Quite a tight squeeze to get to the sink and mirror ,0
3905, I m not usually one to complain but the bathroom towel rail was permanently on and extremely hot The sink in the bathroom was very small Being on the first floor was extremely noisy in the morning and I was awakened early It was very hot in London this weekend and the air conditioning was broken making the room uncomfortable at times I was also unhappy that I d left some change out on the side in the bathroom and when I returned on Sunday evening that money had disappeared I know this is a small thing and it wasn t a great amount of money but it still should not have been taken Another gripe was that a wine glass from the night before was not taken away the next day either ,0
3906, I wonder why we could not choose the table when we had a breakfast Is it separated by race or rank of room we are Japanese I hope not This is the first hotel which the staves designated our table And the tables we were shown were not so comfortable Besides I would like to request to improve the breakfast And about our room honestly I regreted not asking to change another room I wanted have stayed my mother at the room which is better lighted and better view even if I paid extra fee because it was my mother s last 3 days of staying in London ,0
3907, Needs a bit of TLC but overall a very nice hotel Noisy aircon generators outside the room View was actually of them but it is London and we paid around 169 for just bed no breakfast which in London is reasonable ,0
3908, The room was tatty and well worn with gaps in the fitting of the windows and a really very poor standard of maintenance ,0
3909, The room I booked was for my partners birthday surprise and was nice but a little small The package I booked was rose petals and bottle of bubbles on arrival which was lovely The one on the website was a lot larger or an excellent camera shoot Luckily I don t get up in the night but if I had of the space between the wall and the bed would of been interesting as very tight ,0
3910,No Negative,0
3911, 1st room too noisy opposite 2 pubs 2nd room plumbing problem no refrigerator 3rd room wifi signal too weak in room no refrigerator ,0

3913, Small small room First room air did not work However they did change our room the next day,0

3917, Nothing ,0
3918, Building work during the day but this can t be helped ,0
3919, 2nd floor noise from street level but I can deal with that Bed is uncomfortable Old spring Not a good night sleep as a result Shower pressure was not great Overall the particular room we had could be the exception ,0
3920, there was nothing i did not like,0
3921, Drilling started VERY early in the daytime for the ongoing refurbishment,0
3922, I was advised that the restaurant was closed on Sundays which was a pity as the friend I was meeting and I would have liked to eat there The only thing missing was a bathrobe I d have enjoyed a bathrobe subsequent hotels during my trip all had them but the hotels themselves weren t as good ,0
3923, How to get cold water in the bathroom is and remains a mystery Breakfast variety of fruits and kinds of breads is limited ,0
3924, Horrible mattresses sprung chairs pathetic bathroom supplies staff were grumpy and poorly trained Interiors are depressing ,0
3925, The value rating vs money that you get cannot be acceptable for a 4star hotel We were given a room for a single that the adjective tiny does not represent how small it was transformed to get a couple In a 4 star hotel that is far from acceptable After complaining twice since the first time they got us another tiny room we finally got the expected room The images of the hotel s rooms are far from being the real deal A disappointing experience ,0
3926, Never got washcloths ,0
3927, 2nd bed in our double accommodation was a sleeper sofa and the mattress was sheer torture ,0
3928,No Negative,0
3929, Check in was terrible we arrived about 6 pm and it took us 2 5 hours to get the room ,0
3930, Quite some noise came from machinery in the courtyard through closed windows even at night ,0
3931,No Negative,0
3932, Room service menu is a little limited Having said that there are numerous eateries on your doorstep Parking not on site but close by ,0
3933, Bar prices a bit steep but did sort of expect it being such a classy hotel,0
3934, Not enough towel hooks for two people Nowhere to place tooth brush and toiletries near sink ,0
3935, The building is old and the decor shabby What you see on the booking site isn t the room you get Our room was small carpet worn Windows filthy and a tiny bath with a tiny TV ,0
3936, Could have done without a visit from a man to check the blinds once we d checked in The roman blind didn t work very well Room was slightly smaller than one would expect for the money and a little tired ,0
3937, Room rather hot airless Window with obscured glass into internal courtyard didn t open aircon not very effective Only one set of shampoo soap etc ,0
3938, Epensive unless you get a special fare,0
3939, Bathroom a little small 628 but they are updating rooms Shower did not work properly Kept going hot and cold It may have had something to do with the workmen next door But we managed ,0
3940, The biggest issue for me and my group with this hotel is the fact the staff do not appear to have a good command of English and this was hugely frustrating Not only did we stay but we had a huge meeting there with them too It was starting to drive us insane them not understanding simple instructions from us forgetting refreshments etc there is a lack of attention to detail at this hotel too and I do think the language barrier plays a big part in this For this reason alone I sadly will not be coming back ,0
3941, The rooms are in the process of being refurbished but there were holes in the carpet in my room ,0
3942, The prices in the bar were very high The dinner menu was mainly just pub food The long walk to the bedroom from the elevator ,0
3943, Very small bathroom a larger person would not be able to get to the sink given the proximity to the shower screen on the bath ,0
3944, The room on level 3 was above air conditioning units so sleep was not do great as we had to have the window open because it was very hot in the room We was moved to this room after we refused the other room on level 2 because the windows did not open,0
3945, It was all good Our family room which I booked was unavailable so the manager gave us two separate rooms and complimentary breakfast Customer service was first class,0
3946, the room was quite small and the windows not insulated so outside noise and cold air were factors,0
3947, On arrival the doorman asked if I could get out my wheelchair and climb the stairs as the lift would take too long for him to set up ,0
3948, View of an inside courtyard Room virtually furthest from entrance good exercise For the price and given the lead time booking I expected a view of London breakfast way below par for a hotel of this stature Book in took all of 15 minutes as staff struggled to find us a room despite a 4 month lead time,0
3949, We would return to the room after a day out on the city and housekeeping would not have cleaned our room yet at 5 00 in the afternoon and we d have to leave for 30 minute once housekeeping finally came by ,0
3950, My husband was accused of smoking in room he hadnt thy put a letter under our door and took 200 out of my account without permission 4 conversations later they reumbersed monies but it ruined it for me as i was very upset about it They made us feel like criminals and didnt give us a chance to defend ourselves our friend who we met whilst in London is a barrister and was appalled when we told him ,0
3951, My room was cancelled a few days before and I was given a room with a poor view but what made it worse was the fact the windows were dreadfully dirty and it was only the second floor made the room grubby Also the step into the bath was extremely high ,0
3952, Check in was frustrating our room had been allocated to someone else which we found out when we tried to access the room Rooms were generally small and not clean to the standard expected for a 4 hotel In general I felt we paid more than we should have for what we got ,0
3953, Bedroom needed redecorating poor storage facilities Bath very small Noise from workmen along corridor Early morning deliveries below window,0
3954, Unfortunately I got a room next to the kitchen extractor fan which was VERY noisy Room 247 by the way The first night it stopped at 11 p m so that was all right but the second night it did not so I hardly slept at all However when I mentioned this at checking out I was compensated with having my breakfasts taken off the bill and promised a free upgrade next time I come so I ended up feeling more pleased than I had thought I would be I have stayed at the Russell several times before After my sleepless night I thought this was the last time but because of the way my complaint was dealt with I will certainly return ,0
3955, Uncomfortable bed small room windows requiring repair and were drafty and noisy and the room decor was extremely dated ,0
3956, the extractor fan in our room didn t work the window in our room didn t open and as the room was small the poor ventilation was an issue especially when the shower was on also there were no extra sockets so charging our phones etc was difficult We moved to a different room on the 3rd night of a 3 night stay so at least the last night was better but 1st and 2nd nights were disappointing ,0
3957, Tired room with peeling wallpaper stained furniture cracks all over the room The duvet was lumpy however they fixed this right away The iron didn t work very well Extremely cramped toilet as in the sink fitted just over the toilet seat had to be a contortionist to use it however it was clean ,0
3958, We had booked superior rooms but they were unavailable however the hotel gave complimentary breakfast and bottle of wine ,0
3959, Would have liked bigger room and one with a view but you don t go to London to sit in your room Breakfast good but a little expensive ,0
3960, didn t like being woken up an hour before needing to be woken up especially at 3 30am,0
3961,No Negative,0
3962, Despite the grand public spaces the rooms are rather tired in terms of d cor and furnishings and really need to be torn apart and modernized The windows are grubby and haven t been cleaned in years After coming from a four star hotel in Valencia that was exquisite in every respect I realized I had returned to shabby Britain ,0
3963, Automatic 12 5 tip added to everything Why do companies do this It gets right up my nose Leaves you feeling either ripped off or nowty for asking for it to be removed Such a shame Would have been 11 out of 10 otherwise ,0
3964, The Saturday evening bar staff were fairly busy and less attentive than usual The air conditioning was very noisy we opened a window to cool the room but then of course there was noise from outside The bathroom was small fortunately we are small people but even so the space is small for even one person I really do not like the glass doors on your bathrooms less privacy and the light from the bathroom is intrusive if someone is asleep ,0
3965, Room was very tired feeling walls and skirting needed a good sand down and coat of paint Rust damage down back of hand basin clearly visible from toilet ,0
3966, The bedrooms are tiny but saying that we weren t in the rooms a lot ,0
3967,No Negative,0
3968, Front desk receptionist was extremely rude Programmed my key card incorrectly my room was in a far corner of the hotel 4 long corridors I dragged my suitcase and backpack there back and forth twice until they were able to get it right She didn t apologize mostly shrugged and said sometimes it s sensitive Stands out as bad service ,0
3969,No Negative,0
3970, When I arrived at 10 30pm the double room I had booked 129 was not available had been double booked and I was offered a single 129 with a so called free breakfast even though I knew the breakfast was normally 19 so they were actually ripping me off Eventually they agreed 109 with a free breakfast the room itself though was incredibly small so much so I had to move the cahir in front of the door to be able to see the to feom the bed,0
3971, The building is old and there was a lot of noise from banging doors other residents I guess ,0
3972, Was impossible to store extracted breastmilk in the freezer due to hotel policy I could use the fridge at reception but I would have booked a different hotel if I knew this beforehand Aircon was quite noisy windows were dirty ,0
3973, Room rather gloomy due to limited light and external low level noise assume to be some kind of extraction units Extra milk would have be helpful ,0
3974, The rooms were to small and everything crammed in The overall condition of hotel is poor with major decoration work needed Bathroom was in poor condition with bath panels falling off the extractor fan did not work There was excessive noise from outside I e The kitchen vents etc so we could not have windows open at night if we had wanted to open them it was only about 5 which is ridiculous The air conditioning was so loud we could not get a full nights sleep it also seemed to be stuck at one temp even if you adjusted it The TV remote did not work properly so had to use controls on the TV unit itself which meant getting out of bed to turn TV off which at the hotel prices should never be the case we wanted luxury not excercise ,0
3975, Extract fan outside the window droned on and on all day and all night aggravating tinnitus ,0
3976, Have stayed here several time in very nice rooms but this time the room was very tired with watermarks on the ceiling from a leak The shower leaked so much that there was no pressure I was moved to an equally tired room across the corridor but at least the shower worked I was obviously in the budget area but not at a budget price ,0
3977, The first room a twin room facing the court yard was awful noisy air con and windows could not open Unable to sleep But we got another room which was very nice We dont really eat breakfast and it was a little annoying that the reception lept trying to make us book breakfast ,0
3978, The room was a bit small and warm as only 1 window of the 3 could be opened for only 3 inches Our room was on the side of the hotel and the morning sun makes the room so hot Bathroom was a bit disappointing Small very tine sink next to bath like u have in your house in a downstairs toilet your elbow touches the wall when brushing teeth or cleaning face shower head is the old fashioned the one attached to the wall so you cant take the head down ,0

3985, Noise in room was awful toilet was stuck to the side of wash hand basin making it difficult to use very small bathroom windows need replacing urgently this will help with noise I was surprised at breakfast to find only mugs on the table no saucers no table covers tea and toast would be nice if brought to table herb sausages at breakfast scrambled eggs need to be kept hotter as with most of the buffet breakfast was lukewarm ,0
3986, Disabled wet room Was not informed about this during check in,0
3987, the rooms are not so good the first night I stayed on the 5th floor the room was unconfortably cold as the roof is not insulated and the windows are very old and draughty Only lukewarm water in the shower in the morning The second night I moved to the third floor the room was larger and nicer but again the windows were draughty and single glazed and the sink in the bathroom was ridiculously small ,0
3988, Window needed to be washed but not much of a view on the backside of the building anyway ,0
3989, Can not think of anything ,0
3990, shower was over the bath and it was high to get into A walk in shower is preferable for me however it didn t spoil our wonderful stay ,0
3991, Nothing no complaints throughout our stay,0
3992, the shower in the bathroom is not detachable and every time had to wet my hair ,0
3993, I had a double room at the back of the hotel which was a bit noisey due to air conditioner units the room should of had a fridge and being a double room should of had two of everything in the bathroom which it did not ,0
3994, Room wasn t available until 1 5 hours after check in time Bathroom too small we expected a little more from a four star hotel ,0
3995, I can t think of anything ,0
3996, Refreshments in the bedroom were very poor for a hotel of this calibre Wallpaper loose on ceiling All rooms should be in excellent condition,0
3997, Shower went hot and cold and noise from other rooms annoying I know its central London and the traffic noise doesn t bother me but someone throwing up in the next room that sounds like its right by your head is not so good ,0
3998, Could have done with a hook next to the shower to hang your towel on ,0
3999, The room is far away too small than we though and the picture shows the facility is old in the room the sink and drainage hole of bathtub broken and worse We change the room more than one time Enduring the rest of our staying ,0
4000, Despite being on the 7th floor we couldn t believe how noisy our room was from the traffic in the street below Single glazed very old windows that really need replaced though a good wash would be a start Bed was NOT comfy The room was small but clean I think these rooms are for booking com customers you get what you pay for i guess ,0
4001, room was small but no complaints given the price that s London unless you pay top dollar ,0
4002, the toilet was stinking pretty bad normal rooms were not great and looked different from website had to upgrade to premier to get a nicer room and it wasnt as nice as hoped still ,0
4003, The room did not appear to share the classical feel of the hotel It felt far cheaper than the 235 I paid But the bathroom was excellent ,0
4004, Can t think of anything really ,0
4005, No issues,0
4006, The bathroom sink was very close to the toilet therefore lack of room to sit on the toilet properly would be a struggle for a larger person especially a male to sit on in comfort Also lack of mirrors light in the room a nice dressing table chair but no big mirror light to get ready in front of ,0
4007, Hotel is going through a major refund but is definately looking tired,0

4012, The bed that was not so confortabl My room was looking in the inner part of the building and was really noisy outside ,0
4013, Not convinced that teaspoons were replaced each day as they had a feint residual smell No double glazing so room a bit cold and moisture inside window overnight Ridiculous price for breakfast originally 19 which I declined ,0
4014, Had room overlooking courtyard which had massive air conditioning units they were really noisy needed earplugs Tea and milk was not replenished,0
4015, This isn t a dislike but our bathroom was looking abit tired and needed a face lift But having so many rooms I am sure the upgrade will get there We were on tge 7th floor ,0
4016, We had more than a little trouble with a window right next to the bed that we couldn t get closed which caused a very uncomfortable draft in my small room The concierge tried helping and we put in a request for maintenance but it was two windows causing the issue They fixed one the second night but not the other ,0
4017, Had to change rooms twice once because the bath had a chip in it the mirror had a big crack across it and the alternative room given was tiny for the price paid I feel the up keep of some of the rooms is quite poor given the star rating of the hotel We also had to pay to upgrade to a better room which I don t think was fair given the rooms we were offered originally and the quality of them,0
4018, I have used this hotel a few times before and never been disappointed however our room this time 118 was quite shabby inside compared to previous visits There wasn t even any bottled water Also on trying to find the room at 11 30pm after a long day the signage was very misleading and led us to a door which was closed off and unavailable due to construction We then had to get a member of staff to show us the alternative route which we would never have found had we followed the brass signage ,0
4019, the shower in my room kept collapsing the wind howled through the window all night such that the air conditioning v noisy kept kicking in to keep the temperature up kept coming on i eventually had to turn it off We had a whisky nightcap in the bar which had bits floating in it The waitress explained it was from the ice We had specifically ordered without ice It took two of us complaining twice to get it changed V poor considering 12 50 per glass Breakfast v average more like a 3 star hotel ,0
4020, Cold room no fridge or mini bar TV was useless and would barely work room was a bit tired ,0
4021, sound insulation our room gave on the street and it was really noisy small bed a bit expensive,0
4022, I wanted to do a checkout the night before I left due to an early train and I was surprised it wasn t possible The next morning checkout took a little longer than planned and we missed a train to the airport getting us there later than planned But the great thing was Reception had kindly printed our boarding cards for us which made up the time ,0
4023, I have been staying at the Russell several times a year for twenty years though less frequently now I feel that breakfast arrangements are less customer friendly than they used to be paper napkins have replaced fabric there are no saucers for the coffee cups and I had to go hunting for a desert spoon and a teaspoon ,0
4024, My room on the 7th floor had been refurbished but some of the fittings were of poor quality and should have been rejected ,0
4025, Room small overlooking air con units and the windows were screwed shut Had to rely on air con not a comfortable night ,0

4027,No Negative,0
4028, its a very old hotel undergoing rehab which made for some noise and dust However the worse part of the hotel was the internet We needed to work and were unable to connect to anything workable Its a cool old hotel but if you re going on business and need internet bring your own ,0

4032, we had no cold running water with 2 days to go we were offered another room which was a bit of an inconvenience to move our things and room was much smaller we were offered breakfast on next 2 mornings as compensation as it wasn t included in our price so that did make things a lot more acceptable ,0
4033, The Windows in the bedroom had broken sashes and paint flacking off and odd bodged tiles around the toilet,0
4034, Windows are made with frosted glass so there is no way to see the view or even to open them No mini fridge in the room There is no information on how to call the reception from the room The sink in the bathroom was blocked and hook for the towels was just laying in the hole detached from the wall photos attached Moreover there was very strange sound coming from the street which was annoying and disturbed our sleep Water costs 5 ponds per bottle Do not feel like 4 stars at all ,0
4035, The confusion at check in as I d altered the booking from double and a single room refunderble to a twin and single none refunderble they said that I still had the refunderble booked and needed to pay as to late to cancel luckerly I had proof on my phone but they still insisted I contact booking com to check,0

4038, WOULD APPRECIATE A 2 LEVEL CHARGE FOR BREAKFAST I ONLY EAT A BOWL A CEREAL MATRESS TOO SOFT ,0
4039, Small beds Premier Inn is ahead of most hotel chains on this front Also cost of a glass of wine at 10 for a relatively basic Malbec was a bit steep but they have to make their money back somewhere ,0
4040, The breakfast could have been cheaper ie included in the price We were with a party of 17 there wasn t any negotiation on the price ,0
4041, It was a bit noisy with busy road just outside,0
4042, The room was much smaller than the one we had last time ,0
4043, Despite it being Midwinter the temperature of the rooms was very high and the air conditioning made no difference Even the alternative room we were offered was just as hot ,0
4044, During my last 2 days the WiFi connection became very weak and spotty Staff said it was being worked on but I sensed that a fast resolution wasn t high enough priority ,0
4045, The windows in our room were unfortunately in need of repair with one rather loose glass pane rattling every so often from the traffic on the streets below Traffic is heavy from 6am so this meant no lie in for me Double glazing may help ,0

4049, Room was clean but in need of some repairs eg broken tiles on bathroom floor and bottom drawers badly worn ,0
4050, Despite being in the heart of London but the location is very noisy and inconvenient A lot of people move around super noisy and you would never feel piece of mind on top of that single rooms are very small like a grave I would never stay there again ,0
4051, Location was not very entertaining from tourist point of view I had a room with inside view so felt very suffocated ,0
4052, TV is at a height and an angle where you cant watch it when sitting in a chair You either have to sit far away or stand up not to get a distorted view Breakfast not being included in the room rate is a big minus for me ,0
4053, The mattress bed sheets comforter and pillow not comfy enough Aicon a bit noisy ,0
4054, the noise level in my room from the ventilation put it this way I woke up 3 times,0
4055, Not a dislike but some areas could do with a spring clean Its a busy hotel so difficult to close areas off to follow this through However this would not stop me from staying here again,0
4056, The noise It was extremely noisy in the morning from 5am with the sound of sirens going to the nearby hospitals Every 3 minutes in fact The standard twin was small and bathroom tiny ,0
4057, Ran out of hot food items eg bacon sausages left waiting for breakfast on both days windows don t open in the rooms for security reasons so no fresh air in the room Hotel bar prices are quite expensive ,0

4066, Nothing not to like at a 120pn price point,0
4067, The only reason i booked with hotel Russell was because of the bath advertised to be in my room but when i got there it looked nothing like in the picture it was dirty and had badly chipped enamel there weren t any complementary items worth mentioning just a small amount of cheap shampoo and the room took ages to heat up ,0
4068, the chaise lounge in the room needs some attention looks a bit shabby ,0
4069,No Negative,0
4070,No Negative,0
4071, we had 2 rooms booked and one wasnt ready at check in time we had to wait an hour for it the bathrrom in one of the rooms was tiny,0
4072, Absolutely nothing,0
4073, Lifts are little small so at busy times and with suitcases became a challenge More drawer space would ve been helpful and compliment refreshments tray would ve benefitted from bottled water Room overlooked all the boiler pipes etc which at times was very loud Nice breakfast but over priced for what it was,0
4074, We stayed last year and our room was nicer didn t like the view from 246 the machines heaters or what ever they were noisy However would still stay again ,0
4075, The room was drafty but it s an old building and the room was on the corner I expected it and it wasn t much of an issue ,0

4081, Maid didn t make the room two days,0
4082, Very very poor sleep during stay ,0
4083, Odd that a posh hotel was pushing adult channels in the rooms Don t people have the internet The dinning room was great but the plastic tables and supermarket breakfast was a let down Staff were not the same standard as the hotel the bar was dirty and always had to get up to ask for things despite there being 3 people behind the bar chatting to each other All in all a great hotel but not well run ,0
4084, We felt that the bathroom was missing several items that you would expect to find in such a hotel I e Toilet brush shower cap cotton wool face cloths The room had a very narrow window looking out over a boiler or something similar This was supposed to be a superior room but that was hard to believe ,0
4085, Windows need cleaning Shower slow to drain and sink faucet leaks need fixing The only real complaint is that the doors of other rooms closing along with the fire doors at night are fairly noisy and could keep a light sleeper up ,0
4086,No Negative,0
4087, The air conditioning in are room didn t work so well so it got really warm didn t feel the need to complain as we loved staying a spa would of been nice in the hotel also,0
4088, The hotel ventilation units were just outside the window working 24 7 you can not imagine the noise check the photos No refrigerator Room was rather small,0
4089, This property is listed as accessible My daughter uses a manual wheelchair but is able to stand for very short periods THIS FACILITY IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE IF THEY SET UP A MOTORIZED DEVICE much like a stairway system installed in one s home Can you imagine the trouble it would be to have that device set up each time you came and went The embarrassment and time wasted cannot be estimated I ended up carrying my daughter s chair there was not always a doorman present up the 5 6 steps while my daughter hauled herself up and down using the railing This facility is not accessible unless you come and go once a day with scheduled times In fact when we first arrived a bellman told us there was not a way to get into the hotel w a wheelchair The staff requires education Later that evening the manager called and apologized for staff being unaware of the electric system Please change your listing to not accessible The table floor lamp was tipsy when we wrote on the surface it would almost tip over The bathroom appeared clean but the shower curtain smelled mildewed ,0
4090, Tiny room for 200 while listening to people stamping around above and paper walls next door Had enter and leave the room very awkwardly just to get in and out due to no space Ridiculous price and nothing like what is shown in the pictures on booking Beware ,0
4091, Lack of toilet facilities on the ground floor Opposite end of the hotel to the restaurant and bar which when you have mobility issues can be a long trek ,0
4092, The hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and needs it in a lot of areas We were offered a choice of rooms including a quiet room This turned out to be a pokey double bedroom at the front of the hotel facing onto the square with single glazed windows Noisy all night bath did not drain and bathroom was pokey small Was changed to a better room on second night which was much better but beware of hit and miss and make sure to ask for a quality room ,0
4093, I generally do not eat breakfast in the hotel partly because Carluccio s is close at hand and I am more interested in Italian cuisine than a more conservative English hotel cuisine I hesitate to say that I am unhappy with the dining room or the bar because the hotel is so wonderful in other respects Nevertheless these might be the only parts of the Russell that would benefit from change That being said however few hotels manage change successfully and I would hate to see the Russell lose its undoubted charm ,0
4094, The bed was itself very uncomfortable and very noisy which really spoil tour trip The pillows were well used and lumpy The breakfast was not the best coffee and tea were not great tasting some breakfast items were Luke warm and queuing up to make toast ,0
4095, Found the room far to hot comparable to when I slept in Egypt but that s probably personal to me Would of liked a room with a view but what do you expect when paying less than normal price and you are only sleeping ,0
4096, Bedroom was small but to be expected staying in a double room in London if you wanted something spacious maybe upgrade to a delux we didn t and regretted it But overall enjoyable hotel would defiantly return,0
4097, The room we had was v small for the amount we paid 135 for one night You could only just walk around the bed and there was hardly any space to store clothes,0
4098, no mini bar in the room and the temperature controls didn t function properly Small tv screen ,0
4099,No Negative,0
4100, Our room was very substandard for a deluxe double with cracks on the bathroom floor a leaking sing no mirror with the vanity table the bed was not completed with cushions and throws and the overall ambiance of the room was awful ,0

4103,No Negative,0
4104, No double glazing on our windows so traffic noise awful from 5am No conditioner in the bathroom no shower caps breakfast food was pretty ordinary Seems like it s now aiming at the Imperial hotels market which is frankly down market Used to do better ,0
4105, Room was tired looking very small and Windows had so much condensation damp I had to use a towel to dry it off Not good for my asthma,0
4106, I didn t like the breakfast for the price it cost I ve stayed at other 4 Star hotels with much more variety The bed creaked and in order to open the door with the card I had to make several attempts ,0
4107, We have stayed here many times and will again but we were this time under a very creaky floor room 625 so were disturbed by noise several times which has never happened before Will maybe avoid this room next time ,0
4108, The lifts are very small Breakfast has no fresh salad such as sliced tomatoes cucumbers I would also add some more selection of cheese and sausages,0
4109, The first room they gave us smelt of cigarettes Then we were put in a tiny room sink was blocked shower didn t work properly also the television didn t work very well ,0
4110, Would have expected a touch more luxury in the rooms for the price Shower hard to control and poor flow mouldy silicone sealant cracked tiles Not really worth the extra money back to premier inn in future ,0
4111, The room we were offered standard double was nothing like that advertised paid for superior double No bath no view in fact no window I can only describe the room as a converted broom cupboard I am very dissapoibted with both the hotel AND your booking system which is extremely misleading at least when marketing this hotel ,0
4112, Breakfast was too expensive so went elsewhere could hear a low generator humming throughout the night,0
4113, Bathroom facilities very small and cramped not really suitable for my pregnant wife so larger people would have been very uncomfortable Room a little dated and check in was slow Due to roads being closed around Bloomsbury square car park the hotels suggestion and discounted offer the car park was only accessible by one road which neither the hotel staff or police could direct to 45 mins later we found it Was only a short walk so could be better on other days ,0
4114, The bathroom was that small you couldn t reach the sink unless you were stood sideways If the radiator had been on it would have been very uncomfortable,0
4115,No Negative,0

4117, I have never seen a worse bed in any hotel I ve stayed in anywhere in the world Was well past its best and staff knew it as they instantly refunded my payment ,0
4118, tray of used crockery etc outside my door when checking in to my room Still there several hours later thermostat limited on very cold night Not warm enough ,0
4119, however the rooms were not maintaned so well as the common parts of the hotel TV handler did not work wifi did not work phone in the room did not work Concierge was nice and came into my room to repair but definetly rooms are overpriced they are old and need a strong refurbishment ,0
4120, The buffet breakfast was the single worst hot buffet I ve ever had Plates were dirty with dried on food and when told about this the guy behind the buffet just gave me another plate also dirty with no apology Sausages only cooked on one side congealed beans hash browns literally dripping grease Such a shame as the dining room could be an asset to an otherwise decent and historic hotel ,0
4121, Decor is extremely tired and dated Wallpaper peeling off walls windows did not open mould around window edges and in shower grouting antiquated bathroom and a standalone heater in the bedroom Dust around edges of carpet I m not sure how this is acceptable in a central London hotel which costs upwards of 110 per night Definitely will not be recommending this hotel to friends or re visiting myself although I can t praise the staff enough ,0
4122, There was nothing that we didn t like ,0
4123, Had a bad experience with room service 45 minutes we waited until we called to chase up then we were told it would be another 15 minutes Clearly they didn t make note of our order from our first call We also paid for late check out until 2pm but were disturbed 3 times by housekeeping obvious lack of communication ,0
4124, Bathroom could be more taken care of windows were old and a little worn off There could be possibility to go to the balcony,0
4125, Personal not amiable The room did not match the pictures on the website The AC in my room was really noisy and it took me 4 visits to the reception for them to change my room ,0
4126, Bring earplugs Lots of traffic noise but no problem with earplugs in ,0
4127, Bar and lounge area were very dark so made it difficult to read books or magazines or any literature that we wanted to review for a next days adventures,0
4128, The breakfast experience is like something out of BHS They need to make it a little more like an quality hotel experience Also the bar is a disaster they don t know whether they are running a pub type facility ie bar service or a lounge facility ie waiter service I won t go in again ,0
4129, Nothing ,0
4130, My room wasn t very clean Dirt chunks coming out of heater onto desk When I mentioned that at front desk they just smiled at me White spots on extra blanket So I didn t want to use it Although I love the location and this is my 2nd stay it will probably be my last ,0
4131,No Negative,0
4132,No Negative,0
4133, There was a large cobweb in the corner above the TV room 225 The bar area was difficult to find a seat so I had to resort to staying in my room when I just needed to sit down rest and have a well deserved beer ,0
4134, Had to wait for a second room as first one did not offer a bath as requested Freezing room until radiators kicked in Tired carpet Poor insulated windows,0
4135, Auto service charge Paying extra for breakfast Good food but no better than other UK 3 4 star I ve stayed in No soundproofing ,0
4136, The bar prices are astronomically high so we left the hotel and spent the evenings elsewhere ,0
4137, We booked a superior then upgraded to a junior suite we found a mouse in the room and it was handled terribly They moved us to a smaller room with a bad view and it was 2 single beds pushed together They gave us the 60 it cost to upgrade back and offered us complimentary breakfast but after seeing a mouse in our room there was no way we were going to eat there They then offered champagne which when it came to the room was not champagne at all it was sparkling wine For the amount we paid to find a mouse in the room and for the staff to not even care it s fair to say we will never be staying there again ,0
4138, My room had the old style windows and so the draft and noise from the main road was slightly inconvenient but did not detract from my experience ,0
4139, Not very clean and rooms not really looked after lots of little things were very worn dirty or broken in the bathroom and room ,0
4140, Breakfast pricing of 19 for 2 ppl was not included in our stay deal Seemed a tad disproportionate and unfair but perhaps London thinks it can justify that price for egg bacon a sausage toast and tea we had breakfast at Giraffe Cafe 2 minutes away very nice ,0
4141, We got a room that was very small and not very fresh The pictures on the hotels website for std dbl room was not what we got We could change room though ,0
4142, We had booked a superior double room but were given a twin with sofa bed when we asked about this we were told there were no double rooms we could have but to compensate were given free breakfast Our room was on the second floor and the night we stayed there was a wedding reception in the ground floor reception room directly below us which meant putting up with loud music well after midnight I was surprised not to have a mini bar in the room and there were no hangers to hang long articles of clothing presumably the height of the hanging rail was intended for wheel chair users I also found I kept banging my elbow on the handrail in the shower over the bath again an adaptation for disabled guests The shower head could not be angled to anything other than straight down which meant standing awkwardly so as not to get my hair wet no shower cap provided and it also did not stay at the height I required and needed constant raising We went for breakfast at probably the most popular time and had to wait for a table even though there were tables for two empty and next to each other which could have been pushed together to accommodate the three of us couples were taken from the queue behind us and seated whilst we had to wait for a larger table to empty when a table of six left theirs was seperated to make a four and a two So why couldn t two tables be pushed together for us earlier ,0
4143, Staff at the reception didn t give us 2 sets of cards The lights went in one of the rooms and no one told me that my son was moved to another room ,0
4144, No leisure gym facilities ,0
4145, The decor while nice is a little tired e g fabric on chair is torn woodwork chipped This was only a small point but is a bit out of step with the grand exterior and reception area of the hotel ,0
4146, Some noise at times if staying on the front of the Hotel from road noise But the windows and curtains muffle that overnight ,0
4147, Only a few things the blind in the bathroom covered with dirty fingerprints and the one in the bedroom coming away from windowframe Also couldn t get the shower to work but that may just have been me ,0
4148, Our bedroom was very small that together with our very small bathroom and the continual annoyance that the water in the bath was very very very slow exit added to our chagrin I did mention to Reception staff the problem we encountered with our bath however nothing transpired to resolve this matter ,0
4149,No Negative,0
4150, Bar staff did not know that a egg benedict had bacon in it No wake up alarm despite the fact that they asked if i wanted it ,0
4151, Breakfast seemed chaotic the first morning we went to the buffet to get our cooked breakfast when we returned to the table it had been completely cleared the very disinterested supervisor apologised but did nothing in the end we had to go to another table to get cutlery and cups breakfast was now cold coffee did eventually arrive I like hot milk with my coffee which wasn t a problem but in the second morning the hot milk arrived but was quite clearly off it took some minutes for anyone to come close to the table and even longer to get a replacement cup and milk the cup had a huge chip in the rim so yet again we had to wait,0
4152, Nothing,0
4153, Unwanted alarm call at 7 am rather spoiled my day But got our breakfasts free to compensate so pleased with that Breakfast room needs refurbishment to make more of the Titanic connection ,0

4159, The room which we were in was a standard one needs a revamp There was black mild on bathroom tiles if any older persons were stopping in that room it s very difficult to get into the bath ,0
4160, the food choice in the restaurant is not very pronounced and exciting more fresh fruit at breakfast,0
4161,No Negative,0
4162, During our stay there was a problem with the toilet not clearing however this was fixed fairly quickly and another room given to use that toilet whilst we were inconvenienced So a minus and a plus here We had a meal arranged for Christmas lunch and my wife who is partially disabled had to flag down a taxi for herself directly outside the hotel even though there was concierge staff on duty nearby I was angry at the lack of helpfulness ,0
4163, Room was small and very basic for price but bed very comfortable View was onto a wall Would be nice to have a mini bar fridge and water plus additional wall sockets We had to unplug TV to charge phone I pad,0
4164, The beds vere hard and unplesant The rooms old and need a renovation The staff in the bar did not know what a frozen cosmopolitan was And they did not give u time to look at the bar meny They wanted to take ur order the minutt you sat foot in the bar Not good at all The hotel was to expensive all in all ,0
4165, That s the beds were not secured and if you sat up in bed to watch TV or read the bed moved forward away from wall The bathroom was a bit cramped around the toilet due to the large sink There was a smell coming from the sink when you used it I think its needs some bleach We did not eat breakfast at the hotel due to the price of 19 50 each for 2 nights would be nearly 80 00 We ate out instead ,0
4166, Nothing staff were not helpful and infact rude it was not what we were expecting it looked dated and nothing like the pictures we then decides to stay at the May fair hotel instead and got a refund won t be going there again that s for sure,0
4167, expensive breakfast went to pret some fittings not right bathroom door did not shut plug in sink didn t Forgivable because its such an iconic building but certainly not competition to the best in the west end ,0
4168, The bar was closed when we returned at 1 o clock on new years eve They wouldnt even bring us a drink to the room ,0
4169, Old hotel with small rooms for 4 stars Construction work right outside my window Could not sleep Did not effect price Rather stay in a modern hotel with upgraded facilities ,0
4170, Room was smaller than cheaper hotel next door Less facilities I e tea coffee selection Music from wedding booming until 12 30 pm Though they did pay for two breakfasts to compensate ,0
4171, The TV didn t work in the standard rooms it s very dated very basic and not what I d expect from a 4star hotel premier inn would have been better shower had mould sort of inside the sealant really noisey this place needs the double glazing looking at,0
4172, The quality of the mattress of the bed was really bad For the money I paid I expected at least a decent mattress ,0
4173, Far from the attractions and Russell Square tube is pointless,0
4174, The hair dryer was attached to a unit that was positioned approximately 8 feet away from the dressing table This is too far away when trying to style your hair Fortunately I had taken my own hair dryer The lighting in the room was too low It would have been helpful to have had a bright light positioned by the dressing table to make drying of hair and putting on of make up that much easier ,0
4175, missed breakfast one day as insufficient capacity in the restaurant and the wait would have been too long as I had to go to a meeting,0
4176,No Negative,0
4177, Wifi didnt work in the room Staff weren t as polite as you would expect for the price Despite changing the key numerous times none of them worked well for the door Cant control water temperature No free water daily Restaurant food disappointing All in all we cant recommend this hotel ,0
4178, Trainee receptionist at front desk was rude and abrupt Very poor and mean selection of tea coffee etc in hotel room and the same for shampoo moisturising etc samples in bathroom ,0
4179, I ordered a sandwich from the limited room service available after 10pm but was very disappointed that the beef slices had an inch of thick fat on each This was extremely poor quality ,0
4180, The dining room was too full and very noisy We did not like having to queue for a table The tap in the bathroom leaked ,0
4181, I feel that the bathroom showers baths could be improved and made more user friendly Having to clamber into the bath to have your shower should be a thing of the past,0
4182, The staff could have been a little more helpful with our luggage They didn t seem to realise that helping us from the door to the lifts would have been a huge help However the staff were very friendly which made up for that ,0
4183,No Negative,0
4184, Although the staff were nice they screwed our meal orders up twice Our room was really nice the first night large room with a window We decided to come back and stay a second night but got put in a terrible room Very small the air conditioning didn t work so we had to open all the windows in the middle of winter to keep it cool There was a bank of about 50 air conditioning units right outside our window so it was super noisy The bathroom stunk of mold and Lynx deodorant The drains were blocked and the bed was terrible It was super hard and super creaky which woke us up a lot in the night Between the creaky bed and the air conditioning units outside the stuffy heat and the mouldy stench we didn t have a very good sleep at all I think maybe we stayed in an upgraded room the first night without knowing An upgrade was offered to us the second night for 20 pounds but we didn t think we needed it and assumed we d have a similar room as the previous night But we definitely didnt On a different topic the adult movie channel was terrible Super fetishy chin strap ons surgical instruments lots of pvc and horrible badly lit ugly people having gross sex Not my cup tea but if you re into that kind of stuff you ll love this place ,0
4185, The main light in the bedroom didn t work and although maintenance came quickly it was never replaced meaning the room was quite dark We also thought we would have a safety deposit box in our room which turned out not to be there ,0
4186, The exterior of the building is magnificent but the interior has seen better days and in need of a refurb At the end of the day the rooms are compact clean and comfortable just don t plan on spending too much time in them which you shouldn t be get outside and see some stuff or go hang in a pub ,0
4187, Shower ,0
4188, Breakfast on Sunday morning was a disaster Arriving half an hour before service was due to close we found a queue to get a table with many many tables waiting to be cleared there was no hot food left and a real shortage of staff Hot food did not finally all come through until an hour after we arrived at the restaurant Staff were great throughout ,0
4189, Some staff not helpful few problems with the room Leaky shower door bed on castors with brakes that didn t work a rattling window and a loose connection on tv,0
4190, The positives seem to end with the building The staff were pretty rude and dismissive particularly in the bar where it seemed like it was all too much effort to bring the food or take a drinks order The room was freezing and the hot water broke for a period of time The breakfast was in a nice room but again it was freezing and most people seemed to have their coats on ,0
4191, disappointed that our upgrade did not live up to expectations of pictures on the invitation email which I suspect were from a different hotel altogether This was misleading The suite was very noisy with traffic on the road outside and noise from the stair well just outside the door I felt this was poor value for the additional money spent ,0
4192, room key was older strip type which failed to work even the replacement was temperamental which was a bit of an inconvenience with me being located on the 8th floor ,0
4193, Very poor Water pressure in sink and had to run tap for several minutes before vaguely warm Toulet did not flush properly Very difficult to climb into bath and shower was one of those you Have to stand in the water flow to adjust Risking scalding or freezing Shower was freezing in morning with no hot water for 5 mins Had to give up Furnishings a little tired ,0

4228, The windows of the room we stayed in were badly insulated there was a draft but as we didn t stay in the room much during daytime it was ok ,0
4229, Unacceptable level of customer service Once we arrived we paid for an upgrade for a more spacious room with a view The room was indeed lovely yet the temperature in the room was extremely low it was FREEZING COLD They send us an engineer to fix the air conditioning system We spent approximately 2 hours calling at the reception and waiting for the engineer to finish his work waiting for the air conditioning system to be fixed At some point we had to leave the room because we had scheduled business appointments The hotel personnel reassured us that by the time we would be back everything would be fine At 11 30pm when we returned to the room we faced the same condition a freezing cold room We spent one hour fighting with the duty manager and the hotel personel till they brought us 2 portable heaters in the room and we eventually managed to heat the room with those heaters The air conditioning system never worked as the hotel personnel kept insisting ,0
4230, The side facing the road is a bit noisy The position of the TV in my room is a bit odd the angle is wrong for sitting down ,0
4231, I booked one double room for myself and my husband and a twin room for my daughters The girls room was lovely and spacious giving them great comfort whereas ours was rather cramped with a small bathroom and not much space to get in and out of the door once our suitcase was on the case stand I also felt the wardrobes were not deep enough to fit suites in without the doors staying open This was even more restricted by the ironing board being located in the wardrobe too ,0

4245, 1 As usually most of hotels in EUR have small rooms 2 they didn t have fridge 3 a little be it expensive,0
4246, Our junior suite was exceptionally tired A challenging room very noisy and cold not at all restful in any way Wires hanging under the tv poor standard of decoration especially in the bathroom Taps in bath overbath shower very stiff and difficult to regulate No water or hot water on the final day Dirty walls in bathroom Poor recognition of problems by staff zero response Mouldy bread in toast bin at breakfast ,0

4248, The facilities were quite basic so I felt it was quite expensive for what it was The view from our room was very disappointing and it took a long time to speak to anybody in reception ,0
4249, No bad experience the Tempus bar needs some refurbishment especially the carpet and the fire place needs to be cheerier especially near Xmas Its a bit dull and dismal overall Ulster carpets recently refurbished the Castletroy Park Hotel in Limerick Ireland they supplied the first carpets which lasted 25 years and the new carpets which transformed the hotel Ditch that dirty burgundy carpet asap ,0

4260, Took up an offer to upgrade to a deluxe suite which was very poor,0
4261, I booked a room for myself and 2 sisters It was a superior room with 2 double beds but it was only set up for 2 people so we had to ask for everything extra I e towels tea and coffee toiletries which was a bit annoying We booked well in advance so it wasn t like they didn t know we were arriving That was the only downside of our stay as the hotel is lovely and it wouldn t put us of staying again,0
4262, VERY over priced Stated as a four star and in my opinion not even close Room floor squeaked every where was annoying unless you made it a game to try and walk from bed to bath without squeaking not possible Room given was NOT the room pictured in the ad when I reserved as junior suite not even close although I was told on site it was one of the best buyer beware Shower bath access was difficult and I am very agile The tub rim to step over was to my knee caps and I am 6 3 so if you are short good luck ,0
4263, The single room is small but I was more bothered by the noise from the hallway The walls are very thin Also there was a little mold on the shower wall on my first night It was removed after I called the front desk about it the next morning Otherwise the bathroom was nice ,0

4269, First had a room in the loft which was extrememly warm and some kind of machine noise outside if we opened the window Not a good night s sleep Very expensive breakfast,0
4270, The location and rooms were lovely therefore it was a shame to be disappointed with the check in process taking at least an hour and with a long queue forming behind On check out the long process was repeated along with forgetting to remove an amount from our credit card for sundries although saying they would do so,0
4271, The Receptionist advised us that our room had a nice view of the park however on getting to our room you had to stand on the bed look out of the very small window to see the park ,0

4273, Nothing,0
4274, Returned 1530 to get ready for an early evening concert to find room not cleaned etc No real apology from desk staff not told what was happening no complaint form available when requested A cup of tea while we waited would have been a nice gesture During our wait heard other guests complaining about the same situation and they were in a suite Not a four star experience Whilst the room was spacious the bathroom left a lot to be desired Access to a small sink was in a gap about 18 inches wide down the side of the bath with a shower screen further reduced by a heated towel rail that projected approx 5 6 inches on the wall side The choice was between bump or burn ,0
4275, I was disappointed with both of the rooms I booked and not sure if I would book again because of this They looked very tiered and in desperate need of a revamp The photos online are misleading of the bedroom and the bathroom was also poor also there was a leak on the stares and had buckets out catching water ,0
4276, The breakfast was ok but I would except much more from 4 stars hotel The business point needs update The printer wasn t working the chairs were so bed I was worried I will fall down Only Irish newspaper ,0

4278, The air conditioning was difficult to control but this may have been down to the unusually mild weekend we enjoyed,0
4279, Rooms could do with a bit updating but that is my personnel opinion ,0
4280, The supposedly double bed room was too narrow and the room was closer to a single than to a double bed room The tv too small No mini bar Even the towels were for one person Plus the inside view was awful and there was a continuous noise from the power installations But after my complaints they transferred me to one much better ,0
4281, Our room was very hot couldn t keep the window open because of the noise the room backed on to the courtyard with all the generators hammering away The air con unit didn t do much Continental breakfast was average ,0

4286, The breakfast was adequate but not fantastic it s probably a good idea to get down early for the breakfast ,0
4287, Breakfast was almost 20 extra per person so we didn t have breakfast ,0
4288, IF I had to complain Id say that a bit of noise comes off the corridor I m not sure if it s the thickness of the walls or the acoustical rating on the door ,0
4289, Lack of double glazing meant it was a bit noisy but it is London ,0
4290, The rooms could do with a bit of refurbishment but that s being quite picky ,0
4291, the hotel room was filthy and infested with bugs Had to be moved into another room which wasn t very nice either ,0
4292, Looked like a room from the 1970s Dim and dismal decor old utility furniture Filthy windows Looked out onto a service shaft Extremely poor value for mopney I stay every few weeks in London usually closer to West End either Charing Cross or HorseGuards all are about the same price and infinitely nicer places to stay TV was tiny and no remote housekeeping brought us a spare ,0
4293, Tv was a little hard to understand but that s being picky,0
4294, Some small details disturbing the last day the room was not completely clean the small cookie MIETE on the nightstand ,0
4295, Nothing at all to complain about ,0
4296,No Negative,0
4297, The bedding and bathroom were immaculate however The wooden sash windows were loose fitting and rattled so we wedged with tissues They were also really filthy on the outside masking the magnificent London skyline view from the sixth floor The kettle also had a significant leak when filled for 2 cups ,0
4298, Tired d cor loud air conditioning unit outside room Whitewashed windows so we could not see outside This was a bit oppressive ,0
4299, Rather expensive with small room and no breakfast included We have stayed nearby in similar rated hotels with better facilities and with breakfast included ,0

4301, Breakfast did not meet the price Little variaty in food Room windows were out towards a shaft were the ventilation was very noisy all night Saturday night we had the pleasure of listening to the loud music from a nearby or in the house disco ,0
4302,No Negative,0
4303, Tried to contact room service but the phone rang for 10 minutes as the reception was busy ALL the numbers go through 0 including emergency and first aid requests There should be separate numbers for differing functions or more staff answering the phone ,0
4304, paint is pilling in our room ceiling constant noise of slamming doors due to the aggressive automatic door closer ,0
4305, Was shown a very small room when I arrived I felt it was too claustrophobic so I upgraded but for the price I paid it wasn t good plus I had to pay extra for breakfast ,0
4306, Overpriced bad nights sleep due to noise from the street and a strange squeaking noise which carried on day and night ,0
4307,No Negative,0
4308, We had a tiny room not comfortable at all The room would perhaps suit a single but not a double occupancy and should not be sold as such ,0

4312, The room was extremely small and as were staying for 4 nights was extremely cramped I had requested an upper floor room but was given a room on the first floor which I do nor class as an upper floor Our room was at the back of the hotel directly opposite a pub It was extremely noisy until the early hours and then the noise began again prior to 7am when they were obviously taking the empty bottle out ,0
4313, The room was quite dark and had too few electrical outlets If I needed to plug in my laptop I had to unplug the lamp as there was only one outlet near the desk That made the room even darker In 2015 a guest expects better Also your website says that the checkout time is 11 00 whereas according to the guest directory in the room it s 12 00 This inconsistency should be corrected ,0
4314, There s a lot more that could be done Unemptied bins ashtrays Basic amenities Single bedrooms are very small I was expecting small but still surprised ,0
4315, My error in believing my reservation included one more night but the HR handled this with grace despite my embarrassment ,0

4327,No Negative,0
4328, The room was freezing on arrival Touch ages to work the system out and at least an hour to warm up the room The shower was cranky and quite old Took forever to wash my hair Overall decent hotel but the price reflects the location not the hotel I wouldn t pay that amount anywhere else for the type of hotel but it is expected I suppose in central London ,0
4329,No Negative,0
4330, The room was spacious but chilly and the traffic noise from outside prevented us from having a good nights sleep There were two very large windows in the room both single glazed so outside noise was easily heard in the room ,0
4331, There wasn t anything we didn t like and would stay at the Hotel Russell again ,0
4332, Not exactly a bad experience but I was disappointed with the quality of facial and toilet tissues provided really cheap and nasty I expect more from a hotel of this rating ,0
4333, Not having a bath suite ,0
4334, The air con was rather noisy so we couldn t really use it even though the room was rather warm ,0
4335, The single room was very small and completely misrepresented in booking com It was really claustrophobic and tiny I could not upgrade and there was no fridge The worse that happened to me was when had to stay another night and checked online that they had available room and when I went to the front office to ask if I should book online or direct he informed me that the hotel was fully booked and if I booked online he would honour it but he would Rush before me to close the bookings Worse hotel experience ever,0
4336, Let down by lack of attention to detail Bedroom was cramped and lacked sufficient storage space if we had been staying more than one night we would not have had enough room to hang store clothes Bathroom had no soap holder so soap was left in a puddle on sink no additional bar of soap for shower,0
4337, Dinner which I told the head of Drinks and Catering was an absolute disgrace We didn t eat there again ,0
4338, The standard room was very small so upgraded which cost another 40 pound even though I d received an email saying it would visit 16 pound The stay turned out to be very expensive I ve paid at 50 less to stay in a better hotel,0
4339, Couldn t open any windows They were screwed shut Couldn t see out of any windows as a film had been put over them Not happy about this at all Felt shut off from the world and had to go downstairs to the main door to see what the weather was like It was also stifling hot in the morning because of this Walls seemed very thin and could hear every little noise in the corridors when trying to sleep ,0
4340, Bed was very small uncomfortable and noisy quite important when you re paying to sleep Room was small and loud due to the generators outside the window it was hot but you couldn t have the window open due to the noise air con sounded like an aeroplane was landing so couldn t have that on either ,0
4341, We were originally allocated a double room on the fifth floor which certainly left a lot to be desired The window was filthy and all the knobs on the furniture were either broken or loose Not worth 488 00 We were moved to the first floor purely because we requested a safety deposit box ,0
4342, Some signs of Wear and tear Cleanliness could be a bit better ,0
4343, The price did not include breakfast it was not expensive and we paid extra for it but it would have been far better if it had been included ,0
4344, The bed of the single room is so short that I would not fit in it and I am 190cm not exceptionally tall It should be clearly written about the small bed ,0
4345, Hotel staff didn t appear to have a good command or understanding of English The receptionist argued that my debit credit card could not be used as a credit card when in fact it had been used as a credit card at Hotel Russell just a week prior when we first arrived in London for the first half of our stay Had to request management to sort this out Her attitude was non too friendly during this experience As mentioned before we stayed here during the first half our trip as well The movie which cost a staggering 8 could not be enjoyed due to the poor satellite reception though the weather was near perfect Room service the first night was acceptable however on night two the food was not delivered When I called to check on the reason I was told that it was after 10 00pm and therefore it could not be delivered The original order had been called in before 9 00pm As if this was not disappointing enough our reservations which I had made on line weeks before the trip was somehow bungled up and when we arrived on Friday we were told the reservations were for Saturday though I had an email confirmation of that Friday being our arrival date We were able to get a room but then had to switch rooms the following morning as the room we were put in for one night was already reserved The location and appearance of the hotel was not enough to outweigh the overall negative experience of staying at Hotel Russell ,0
4346,No Negative,0
4347, Cramped small bed Bar understaffed and waiter overwhelmed forgot one drink from order and it too 3 requests 45 minutes and Asking the mixologist directly the get the drink,0

4350, They offered us an upgrade which I paid for as it was my 65th birthday and I thought my wife would like it there but rather than an improvement the the room was the worst Ive had there and I have stayed a good number of times The Bathroom was in a shocking state The main air conditioning unit was right out side the window so we couldn t have the window open All in all as great disappointment ,0
4351, The blinds in the bathroom needed replacing as they were very frayed Also the ceiling needed repainting as there had obviously been a leak from the bathroom above ,0

4358, Room was very small but adequate for a one night stay Breakfast was not included in the price but was available at extra cost ,0
4359, We were given what I would describe as someone s flat that they let us have for the weekend It had two separate bathrooms one with a shower the other with a bath The sink in the bath bathroom did not work The staff basically said oh well The room had scuffs on the walls the carpet needed replacing and the bathrooms were obviously in disrepair The room was supposed to be of modern design but fell flat They should embrace the history of the hotel and reflect that in their rooms and service ,0
4360, Had stayed at the hotel a few years ago had a beautiful large room very disappointed with my return visit At 340 for our 2 night stay I didn t expect to get the smallest hotel room I have ever been in was amazed that they managed to shoehorn a bathroom into the space they had There was a bath too I am only 5 feet tall and I couldn t lie down in the bath a good shower stall would have made much more sense The bed was comfortable Everything looked pretty shabby the windows were very dirty didn t matter that much the only view we had was of a white tiled dirty wall Will not return here ,0
4361, It needs a little revamping and we were told a big renovation plan was soon on the way,0
4362, The room was pure value for money I booked a Double Deluxe room but nothing about the room was luxurious It was small poor decorated the bed was on wheels one of the lightbulbs on the ceiling was hanging out of the socket and the toilet roll holder was broken I expect much better than this for a room that costs more than 200 per night ,0
4363,No Negative,0
4364, Room was average for a 4 star hotel 150 was blocked against my credit card on arrival I paid the actual 1 night cost of 99 the next morning with a debit card but was told it would take up to 1 week for the 150 to be released from my credit card ,0
4365, small room dated dark decor very much a quick business stay or ideal fro travellers i prefer crown plaza level of comfort ,0
4366, Room small disappointing with the double bed pressed to one wall water serving bath and shower sink was luke warm not hot Whilst compared to other clients 175 for our small room with no breakfast was clearly a cheap offering by comparison to others available the 4 stars should relate to all rooms not just how impressive the lobby staircase are ,0
4367, Room was small with no view It was decorated cheaply very out of date and tired No mirror to get ready in ,0
4368, The design of the bathroom is appaling room 654 We could not wash our hands Although some of them are smiley the front desk reception could have been more helpful ,0
4369, The showers didn t get very hot,0
4370, The staff were very unfriendly in both the reception area and the restaurant we booked a twin room for our 3 night stay and when we checked in there was no twin room available and we had to take 2 small single rooms No apology I emailed 4 times about my booking no response I rang the hotel 3 times as my flight was delayed no answer We paid for the room on check in and when we went to check out they insisted that we didn t pay and had to find the card receipt to prove we had paid when we gave it to the receptionist we got no apology again and were not asked if we enjoyed our stay I would not stay at this hotel again ,0

4377, not easy to get the wifi to work on my iphone poorly stocked in room tea coffee supply,0
4378, Considering the price of the room the facilities are very basic Only enough tea and coffee for two drinks in the room Also the facial tissue and toilet paper were extremely cheap Although I did not require them extra pillows and blanket were not present You could probably request some of the above however I do not think you should have to ,0
4379, Horribly loud air conditioner Called desk to find out cost to call our car rental They told me no charge and then charged L9 each about 28 total for two calls when we got our bill They did take it off after some convincing Ridiculous charge for breakfast so we opted for local Starbucks ,0

4388, For 200 a night thought the room was a bit basic Couldnt sit on the toilet without banging into the sink Thought the bed wasnt the best Squeaked every time you moved,0
4389, For a four star hotel the room was tired and needed decorating the Furniture was dark and similarly tired the lightfittings needed replacing Room between bath and sink was minimal making it difficult to access sink Standard rooms very disappointing ,0
4390, Traffic noise from the street I was on the 3rd floor The overall feel of the hotel is a bit old Entry foyer felt dark and depressing Others would probably say it was atmospheric but it just felt a bit scuffed on the edges with thick paint job to hide the dings ,0
4391, Room size was smaller than expected The lighting was harsh with the overhead lights Bed and pillows were very hard and uncomfortable Our safe could not be fixed which caused us to put our valuables in the Managers safe very inconvenient ,0
4392, The room is like what they have in Italy I mean the single room is really small The overall cleanliess is OK I wasn t happy with the dust on the towel rack or the desk tho And the fact that a 4 star hotel doesn t have a fridge nor a scale in the bathroom was really annoying ,0
4393, The idea of free wi fi not being free after the first complimentary hour not clear at time of booking or booking in ,0
4394, Had issues getting into the wifi ,0
4395, The room is terribly run down My family has stayed at the Russell Hotel since the war and I have known it since the 70s I ve never seen it look so drab Assume it is cost cutting by a chain ,0
4396, The room they gave us was on the 1st floor no 150 it was a small room looking at the interior of the hotel It was s very dark room It had only 2 windows and you could look out only through the one The only thing you could see were machinery and there was a constant noise that did not stop at all day or night The elevator did not reach our floor we had to take about 12 steps as well I do not know if this room was given to us because we booked a value deal Anyway it was not cheap Also we asked the hotel to book us a taxi for the airport They told us it will cost 55 pounds We were 2 persons and we told them that we had 5 luggage 3 big and 2 small When the taxi driver took us to the airport he charged us 65 pounds because he said we had an extra bag In my opinion this is unacceptable I would not stay in this hotel again ,0
4397, I was put in a room with a tiny bathroom with an overhead shower It was not possible there to help my daughter who has a disability I have said about the disability in my request form It took 24 hours and a lot of my short holiday time to sort things out The initial receptionist s fault to give us a inappropriate room Please train them to be more sensitive to guests needs ,0
4398,No Negative,0
4399, for the rate I paid it wouldn t be fair to complain about something,0
4400, Not really that much of a problem but the bath takes up to much space in the bathroom so it is not so comfortable using the washing basin ,0
4401, The staff didn t speak english very well The junior suite was more like a double room and be sure to ask for a view to the square cause the air vent in the back yard will keep you awake all night The hotel itself need a bit of upgrade it s not a 4 star hotel ,0
4402, The hotel has seen better days The d cor generally was tired Various fittings in the room were in need of repair notably the table which wasn t level and the sink tap which bled black bits after use The room also stank of smoke which got worse when the a c was turned on The staff were generally uninterested On early arrival I asked if I could have access to the room to get changed as I had cut my leg while travelling I wished to dress the cut and change any clothing which had blood on it Two of the three staff members I asked were perplexed by the question despite being able to see the injury The third staff member offered me a Band Aid and use of the ladies toilets Its not easy trying to open a suitcase in a cubicle Five minutes in the room or any room and I would have felt a good deal better disposed towards the venue I particularly didn t like the attitude of the duty manager when we checked out and raised the issue of the faults in the room He implied it was our problem for putting up with it but on past performance ie the lack of effort while I m standing at reception bleeding I wasn t hopeful that anything would have happened I further was not impressed by the implication in pre arrival emails that the hotel was going to upgrade us as it was a celebration stay They didn T Instead they gave us one slice of an inedible lemon cheesecake I remain unimpressed as the promised follow up from the hotel regarding our concerns hasn t happened Breakfast was average Service remained indifferent Not what I expect from a four star hotel I wouldn t recommend or return to it ,0
4403, wifi was rubbish only free for an hour bath was really small neither of us fitted in it ,0

4417, Understaffing at reception means long waits to check in and check out ,0
4418, Loo flush wasn t very effective bit of an acquired skill Not enough plug sockets in room coffee terrible,0
4419, The room was the only let down It was very small and quite dingy The bed and bathroom was perfect although the window only opened slightly and there was a constant noise from a fan which was located above our window Definitely recommend upgrading your room if you get the chance ,0
4420, The bed was comfy but very noisy Every time I turned it woke me up ,0
4421, Didn t have breakfast included in deal therefore 12 if booked night before or 19 the day of it continental was in one area and cooked in another had better for half the price in an ibis ,0
4422, offered a cot 30 alternative was a 45 upgrade bar closed early despite residents and staff still there so offered room service at inflated price Our last experience was great this one poor Money grabbing up selling procedures in place to steal your last pound notes Lifts were too small ,0

4425, not value for money room was noisy very dirty needed serious maintenace cramped with furniture definitely not the room shown on the internet site when making booking we will be telling anyone everyone not to go to this hotel including our travel agency contacts in various parts of the world Concierge didn t even offer to take bags to room on arrival or assist with carrying up the fairly steep entrance stairs interior could do with a refreshment of decor to fit the outside heritage appearance ,0

4434, We had a very smelly room with an unacceptable view of water pipes with green stuff all over there are no fridges so we ordered an ice bucket which after the ice melted turned out to be unclean and had tissues and garbage at the bottom the rooms were not cleaned as it is supposed to be and the wifi wasn t working until we got a voucher key At the end they charged us 200 GBP for smoking which they hadn t stated it was a non smoking hotel The bathroom spaces are horrible which we couldn t fit into the bathroom to just wash our face in the morning How are we supposed to pay a lot of money if we don t get any good service or a decent hotel room suitable for regular sized humans not skeletons I wouldn t recommend the hotel to anyone I know unless I want them to have a bad time in london ,0
4435, Checking in and out was appalling I was told breakfast wasn t included when it was I also paid 100 cash deposit on checking in and when checking out was asked to pay in full again as they had no record Made to feel like someone who was trying to con them I have written to complain ,0
4436, The only let down with the hotel was breakfast we had it delivered to the room and it wasn t good raw egg isn t for me ,0
4437, when we first arrived we were asked of we wanted to pay on arrival or when we left we said when we left and were asked to leave a guarantee of a credit card which we dont have So we had a little trouble but paid for our first night in cash and paid the following morning for the next night ,0
4438, Some traffic noise but no more than you would expect in central London Shower temperature had a mind of its own I wanted to pay by debit card and the margin they tried to add to the bill to cover possible additional spend was excessive ,0
4439, I didn t walk into the room and have the same wow factor that I had when I approached the hotel There was large circle of damp in the celling which was a little off putting The view was disgusting At night it was very noisy from the central air conditioning units ex tractor fans that ran centrally through the hotel which was our view We did ask for an upgrade but there were no rooms available We reminded ourselves that we wanted the hotel for the location and not the room ,0

4445, Paid extra 35 for upgrade as my wife birthday Room was large but refurb above caused a lot of noise at 8am and double glazing had 1inch gap so road noise was extreme After complaining when checking out manager offered 15 refund I complained we shouldn t have been given that room no response Also on first floor the metro can be clearly heard at 5am choose your room carefully ,0

4451, i dont have any thing to say about this hotel it is full of happiness,0
4452, The room was tiny Smaller than my bedroom at home so was disappointed considering the price we paid Definitely not what I would expect for 4 stars Would have complained but got there late after a long journey so couldn t be faced with dragging all our bags back down to reception,0
4453, Room although I was told on check in recently refurbished was still tired looking and the Lighting is terrible Carpet old and scruffy looking Sorry would not return ,0
4454, Basic rooms and pretentious top hatted concierge ,0
4455, Upon arrival we turned AC on freshened up and went out for the day When we returned AC was still not working London was going through a heat spell Called front desk someone came up with a fan and told us there was nothing they could do so we suffered in the warmth of the night Did not help that windows were only able to open about 3 inches Next morning as we were preparing to head out maintenance came informed them to stop back as we were getting ready to leave for the day When we returned later that night AC still did not work I was told that it would not be repaired until the following week after I went to front desk to complain My family was later moved to two separate rooms at 11 00 at night instead of one room This is a very old hotel and it shows We were comped breakfast for two days for three people for our inconvenience Overall I would not recommend this place ,0

4463, Room was shabby and needs the bathroom upgraded Very small bathroom and poor free toiletries Not impressed for 4 star hotel Disappointing,0
4464, We booked a suite intending that our young child would sleep on the sofa bed In the event it was too small and we asked that it be replaced by an extra bed This request was declined on health and safety grounds which appeared implausible An alternative but smaller room was offered with an extra charge for an extra bed which did not address the reason why the junior suite had been booked in the first place,0
4465, The room was tiny and on the day of checkout they told us there was no hot water after 09 30 which meant we had to get up and leave long before the 12 00 checkout time Probably a ploy on their part On Sunday we came back at 17 30 to change for dinner and found the room was still being serviced ,0

4474, This hotel is starting to look very grotty Carpets are stained and the cleanliness could be improved I have stayed for several years at Hotel Russel but having stayed in lots of other hotels it is definitely in need of some refurbishment Also the shower facilities are rubbish There is not even a shelf to place your bar of soap ,0
4475, I was charged 150 as pre auth on arrival and then next day I was charged the room rate of 99 so I have been charged 249 expecting only to be charged 99 which left me short during my stay This is unacceptable practice I have been advised that it will take 3 working days for the pre auth payment to be refunded which is a disgrace ,0
4476, We booked a standard room six months before with the idea that we would be allocated a good one However we were given one on the 6th floor with a tiny wardrobe small windows facing into a quadrangle and an even smaller washbasin As this was for our 50th wedding anniversary we were very upset and complained The response was excellent and the replacement standard room was so much better Management gave us a bottle of champagne and a cake to celebrate our anniversary Pity we had to complain though ,0

4502, None,0
4503, We have stayed here a few times but some areas of the hotel are looking a bit tired we were initially initially in room 119 but requested to be moved after the first night due to being woken at 7am by building work going on outside this was dealt with in a very professional manner by the reception staff and we were moved into 130 which met with our expectations also you have a resident mouse that likes to frequent the bar fairly late in the evening on a regular basis ,0

5261, Housekeeping would bang on your door to wake you up at 830am This is your alarm Very frustrated They will continue banging till you wake up until you told them not to clean up your room in such a morning hours Terrible If we need clean up we would put the paper sign out to make up room No respect on guests Don t expect this Housekeeping will refill your bath gel they only keep those bottles which you don t want to use keep on giving you the same unwanted bottles say conditioner They won t give you slippers cotton pads tho they keep it in their trolley They won t refill your tea sugar when u finished your stay was more than 6 days Doubt they changed your bedsheets too in such a long week ,0

5264, Large queues for breakfast Room was very crammed booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children no space to go in with a pushchair Not enough lifts to cater for guests at times it took us 10 minutes to go down to the lobby restaurant ,0
5265,No Negative,0
5266, The room was spacious enough for a family because there is a sleeping sofa but when the sleeping sofa is unfolded the room door is blocked very small opening to enter the room,0
5267,No Negative,0
5268, Housekeeping is not attentive not caring at all Once when I returned to my room at night there is not even a piece of towels in the toilet Also they won t give you enough set of towels Even if they give you they just left a pile for you to sort They never refill your toiletries needs u have to ask specifically everyday The most essential things when you finished they won t refill it for you But only replenish those you already left in full bottles but with even more that is not what you need E g I have 4 full bottles of conditioners 3 full bottles of shampoo but none for bath gel body cream They don t provide you with basic needs like slippers Cotton pads wools Q tips But we saw it in their trolley Not even refill teabags milk sugar Rooms are considered not clean to normal hotel standard ,0
5269, expensive breakfast especially when you only want a coffee and croissant We went to Starbucks around the corner for this ,0
5270, the traffic near the hotel was madness but that was likely due to the construction going on nearby once that is off the traffic will be better ,0

5273,No Negative,0
5274, Air con control in room did not work properly had to ask reception to turn it off as it was freezing despite turning it to 5 degrees Room very small for a 4 night stay Dispute at check out regarding bar bill all drinks paid for as taken but still had some charged to room ,0

5277, The room was very much smaller than I anticipated It must have been smaller than it should have been because the receptionist informed me that it was very small as I checked in I had expected to have a small living area and that was why I booked this particular hotel as I did not want a traditional hotel room I did not get that ,0
5278, We had a leaky kettle they were light on with milk coffee in the room,0
5279, Apparently the hotel guests before us had replaced 2 of the minibar drinks with their own and as a result we were charged for the 2 drinks Not many cafes and food option nearby,0
5280, Leaking shower Electricity went out one night but we were compensated Temperature in room hard to regulate ,0

5282, Very poor room cleanliness very disorganised housekeeping no towels in room on second day had to ask twice to get it resolved,0
5283, The bathroom needs update the layout is awkward and the faucet is old Also the bathtub door is half way there is no way to avoid water on the floor while taking a shower Secondly the beds are not comfortable enough The hotel can do a little bit considering the rate charged on each room Lastly the air freshener used by housekeeping after daily cleaning smells terrible please change it ,0
5284, As a family of 4 with two young teenagers the room was a bit tight ,0

5290, Seemed slightly shambolic I checked in around 7pm and yet I was told I wouldn t have towels until an hour later although when I actually went to the room the towels were there but the bathroom just seemed a little ehhh I kept finding stray hairs around the place that didn t belong to me Bit gross ,0
5291, Milk in the room fridge Off Breakfast staff 3 days out of the 6 I had to ask for coffee No one checked me All other people couples were asked Perhaps a singles thing Otherwise all good Staff friendly and helpful Location brill ,0
5292, Since we booked studio room with 2 children the hotel did not provide extra sleeping pillows and blanket for the extra bed in the room ,0
5293, The only thing that mark the hotel down on was the room didn t have a window that opened Not a problem with the aircon on but I like fresh air when I sleep The bed was a little uncomfortable but no bed is ever the same as your own The shower head leaked and made the floor wet but that wasn t an inconvenience to me more of a pain for the housekeeping I guess ,0
5294, The view from our room ,0
5295, The location was disappointing due to all the construction in the area which I was unaware of and which spoilt the view from my room I found the area very congested and noisy so would probably not use the hotel again I realize however that this is a personal preference and other guests may enjoy the area ,0
5296, The reception staff were really unhelpful and glum They never smiled Almost any request was too much trouble In a hotel that has no swimming pool or public rooms the reception staff are key These appear to have been poorly selected trained and not proactively managed A poor reflection of the brand and hotel ,0
5297, I discussed my grievance with the duty manager who promised me she would address them upon checkout Upon checkout I was told she was busy however she would email me with her findings As of now now communication have been made ,0
5298, Room had a few damaged bits here and there Very clean though the bed was big but I found it as firm as the sofa bed in our room Air con seemed to be low in the day and fast and very cold in the early hours The other main issue was the lifts In busy times we waited 15 minutes as we had a baby buggy with us I had 1 gripe as I m quite OCD and don t like reusing towels i didn t receive the extra towels I ordered from housekeeping twice once each day ,0
5299, Small for a family of 4 A little over priced for what you get however expected for that time of year Not enough pillows House keeping knocked at our door fairly early which was disappointing as we just flew for 24hours ,0
5300, Air conditioning was a problem We had to let them know twice before it was handled Overall we very much loved our stay ,0
5301, Booked a double room but had two single beds pushed together with two single duvets being with my partner we weren t happy as we had to sleep separated due to this Also there is not enough milk coffee and sugar left in the room,0
5302, Booking com has wrong room advertised for Penthouse suite actual room very disappointing Who is to Blame here Staff at reception not helpful about mix up House keeping is very average and be prepared for very long wait for breakfast in the mornings hotel is more concerned about money than the customer 1st photo is what you are shown of room at time of booking next photos actual room After spending over 800 pounds for 2 nights not happy Hotel says there is nothing they can do about what images are shown of rooms yet all there images are copyrighted as per there website has been happening a long time but I believe they are happy for it to keep happening as when you have booked and arrived it s too late money is paid what you going to do attitude ,0
5303, The breakfast was not how I expected it Also the breakfast staff on the restaurant was not as welcoming ,0
5304, I called the hotel to ask if I can pay the last night of our family stay by Maestro debit card and the hotel staff confirmed this is possible When we checked out appeared it is not possible not a huge problem but staff are giving incorrect information ,0
5305, There is nothing significant to dislike As a way to improve they should provide the following two things especially for families with little kids liquid handwash in the bathroom bottled drinking water because the tap water may not be suitable for young children most hotels around the world in this price range do not charge for water for kids ,0
5306, Breakfast was a little busy Hit the peak you would wait but the staff laid out juice coffee for anyone in a queue Breakfast quality itself was excellent,0
5307,No Negative,0

5309,No Negative,0
5310, There was not much options for the vegetarians in breakfast ,0
5311, Cleaners woke up us too early in the morning breakfast wasn t worth the money and the food hall was too small so we had to wait in line for quite a while bathroom was awkwardly placed in between beds and room wasn t big enough for two people to walk around at once and there was no bin ,0
5312, I was disappointed I emailed and went to no end of trouble to explain what we wanted Everyone was confused However we were told in the end we could upgrade for another 100 00 pound a night which annoyed me We did this as the room we had was dark and too small there was always confusion about things The two tvs were so quiet we couldnt hear them so every time we turned them on we had to call the maintenance man to turn them up which was so annoying In the end they left us with their remote so we didnt have to do it Concierge was very good but depended who was on Breakfast was ok but really really busy Overrall I wouldnt stay again as I would rather be in the middle of the town We had to take a taxi to Oxford St all the time ,0
5313, Nothing not a thing my son and I loved it ,0
5314, The digging outside the Reseption But of course this will be finished ,0
5315, They need to provide slippers The fridge needs to be bigger To give you an idea of its size it could only fit two 1 5 liter soda bottles ,0
5316, Could have been more child friendly There were kids in the group that were 4 and six No facilities for children to play or be entertained ,0
5317, Small and very dark room ,0
5318, Sofa bed was terrible did not sleep whatsoever on the first night The bars were poking through the very thin mattress The amount of money paid for the accommodation I was expecting at least a comfortable bed Everything else was terrific The location and cleanliness A1 ,0
5319, Our first room was not to our liking We paid a reasonable amount for and upgrade the following day and we were much happier ,0
5320, Booked the hotel room one month prior to the check in date to get the the best price possible However I found out that the room rate went down considerably before my stay More than 350 GPB for 8 nights Communicating with the hotel management they did not agree to lower the price Booking com made a wonderful gesture keeping its promise of best price guarantee Booking com refunded me 352 GBP the difference in the price Thank you Booking com for keeping the promise ,0
5321, I did not like the bathtub with the shower The shower was difficult to use without getting water everywhere and the bathtub was difficult to get in and out of ,0
5322, Restaurant is dual purpose Good menu in the evening and very professionally run by the staff Breakfast very ordinary I am afraid Food from the cooked options cold Toaster both of them are not user friendly especially when there are children using them Tried the option of ordering breakfast next day as per the options Eggs Benedictine were excellent as was the restaurant service ,0
5323, The sound proofing of the room is terrible and you could here everything outside the door and in other room The layout of the room is very strange with the bed just beside the door and living room at the end of the room The location of the hotel is ok it looks very close to the underground but actually need to walk 10min from the station Not impressed with the service of the staff either ,0
5324, They purposely not allowed my parents to check in one hour earlier since the room was ready The reason I wanted to check in earlier because my parents took a 15hours flight and need to take a rest before going out but the lady said the hotel policy stated check in time is at 3pm but before that she kept on allowing other customer non asian customer to check in I FELT DISCRIMINATED ,0
5325,No Negative,0
5326, It was a bank holiday so breakfast was not served at 6 30 AM as expected We had to wait until 7 7 15 AM so a rush to get to the airport for our early morning flight ,0
5327, Only one point toilet paper holder doesn t work the roll keeps popping out,0
5328, Disappointed by Bar staff was ignored for ten minutes bar was quiet and staff were chatting to each other and when I finally got attention and asked for half a lager I was told rather rudely that I d need to wait until my allocated waiter was free I waited for a few more minutes I had been walking in 35 degree heat and finally gave up ,0
5329, There was a lot of construction in the area and the outside of the hotel is not picturesque but location makes up for this I would recommend asking for a room with a view I didn t even think about this when booking but was so happy with our room location on an upper floor The bathroom had a sliding glass door which lacked privacy this was not a big deal as I was traveling with my husband but might be weird if traveling with friends ,0
5330, TV didn t work Poor lighting in room Poor toilet roll fittings No dressing gown or slippers Could have been cleaner Room had no privacy as overlooked by other rooms Also room overlooked restaurant Not up to 4 star rating Shower difficult to operate,0
5331,No Negative,0
5332, Room temperature and debris falling from the air conditioning ,0
5333, Getting woken twice up by drunken people shouting and hanging around in the corridor at 4am Not what you d expect with security about only sorted it once we called reception Bad night sleep ,0
5334, The traffic was a shambles outside the hotel,0
5335, There were no actual shops nearby I like to step out on the street and have things to look at We had to taxi to the main centre of London,0
5336, The room was a little hot during the night even with the air con turned right up as no windows that could open in the room,0
5337, Impersonal ,0
5338, Each day breakfast we had to ask repeatedly for a spoon for our coffee Sometimes we had to ask several times Even then sometime we never receive it Not impressive Major construction in front of the hotel It was loud with a lot of dirt and dust being thrown into the air Careful you don t get it in your eye or breath too deeply Everything else was good ,0
5339, poor wifi all staff were nice except Ramzi at the bar who was unwelcoming and seemed to hate his job ,0
5340, The tv in the bedroom was inset too far into the cubby where only one person can see the tv ,0
5341, the images they showed for executive studio city view while booking had a great city view and when i physically saw the room there is this hotel right in front blocking the view It wasn t worth spending the money ,0
5342, Crowded reception and queues Room 109 room is next to something that makes noise during night which sounds like patio being opened Appalling breakfast grumpy staff queues and restaurant crammed tables too close to each other not big enough for restaurant,0
5343, Nothing location was excellent staff were super helpful and their Italian restaurant a had extremely good good at reasonable prices,0
5344, We couldn t open the curtains in the morning because of the heat The airconditioner did NOT cope Hot I don t know how you could stay there if the weather was actually hot The view from our room was Waterloo Station ,0
5345, Noisy until 2 am Adults and children talking in the aisles slamming doors and no one from the hotel asked them to be more respectful ,0
5346, Cooked breakfast option was dreadful Bacon looked like it was mechanically shredded no rashers just bits Scrambled eggs tasted disgusting Beans were only warm Stuck to the much nicer fresh option Triple room flooded as soon as shower went on Spoke to reception who said she was unable to reduce the bill ,0
5347, Too many issues to get sorted with the room Bath plug not working no remote for the T V piece of skirting board kept falling off which had a nail sticking out had to keep asking to get tea and coffee renewed and for the sheets to be changed Staff were very helpful and kept sending people up to sort problems but for what we were paying we expected more There were also a lot of roadworks outside the hotel which meant we didn t use the hotel cafe and it took longer to walk some places ,0
5348, A bit of construction around the area,0
5349, Room wasn t cleaned very well during my stay cups were stained and they left my PJs on the table but despite this the place was quite clean overall ,0
5350, Although I wrote through booking com two different request and question to the hotel I never got an answer for the question and for the request only on the day of arrival The breakfast area is very small and though we were lucky and never had to wait but if you arrive around 9am be prepared to wait Some of the waiters are not always on the top of their job had to ask several times to refill eg milk and also came across a bad fruit salad once But overall nothing major and the good intention is there Last thing we were unlucky I guess our room for 3 was on the 2nd floor looking to the train station meaning bad view and WiFi was fairly weak in or room ,0
5351, Would have appreciated a late check out say 3 00 pm for freshen up prior to train journey ,0
5352, Not enough shower gel body lotion etc Also I had to request our complimentary water it wasn t already in the room ,0
5353,No Negative,0
5354, Not for business travelers I requested a quiet room but was awoken by kitchen preparation resteraunt etc every morning and evening,0
5355, Strange layout with toilet in the middle of room with kitchen part and with sliding door didn t have much privacy Breakfast area over crowded and difficult to move around does not seem big enough for size of hotel and food not really fitting of the rest of the hotel,0
5356, All in all a great hotel ,0
5357, Would have preferred a room with a bath the room we were given was fine o list wanted to have a bath after walking so far ,0
5358, I liked everything ,0
5359, The hotel like many central London hotels for obvious reasons doesn t have its own car park and the excellent one right next to it that we usually use was closed due to road works and layout changes We found one online at Upper Marsh which had the advantage of booking in advance and has an attendant but it is more expensive and on getting home we found a nail in one tyre and a screw put into another and couldn t think where else it could have happened There are other parking options not too far away particularly if your vehicle doesn t need the high clearance room ours does Will ask the hotel for parking advice in advance next time or fly ,0
5360, The room was a bit tired and the tea coffee facilities weren t replenished I had to ring up and ask It was delt with quickly upon the phone call,0
5361, Excellent location Very close to the London Eye and the Waterloo train station Unfortunately this 14 floor hotel has 3 very slow elevators Once it took me 10 minutes to reach my room at the 13th floor from the reception With the price they are charging it is simply ridiculous to have such an experience,0
5362, House Keeping should be able to speak and understand english as when i asked for something we coudn t communicate,0
5363, Bed a little hard and noise from the lift outside ,0
5364, Couldn t open the windows to the room to let in fresh air and the pillows were too thin which made the sleep difficult,0
5365, Receptionist attitude on checking in to be told they didn t have 2 rooms next to each other even though an email had been sent requesting this and a reply received back says no this had been noted and was no problems ,0
5366, I had to make an emergency phone call to Australia and my phone wasn t charging I asked staff they said of course I didn t think to ask of cost They charged me 100 pound for a 10 minute call disgusting ,0
5367, N a,0
5368,No Negative,0
5369, Breakfast was disorganised and needed more than one chef Queued for a table and breakfast staff seemed stressed and not that helpful No toilet brush in bathroom which could prove unpleasant with people sharing especially children ,0
5370,No Negative,0
5371, Bed was hard and squishy room 620 Tutorial for shower and lights would be helpful ,0
5372, The hotel was clean and presented very well but the bar area looked like it needed some updating the chairs and carpets were worn ,0
5373, as above breakfast was expensive an food quality was poor you get better food at school ,0
5374, Everything was great I thought we staying across the road which had a pool this one dident,0
5375, Service in bar a little slow but that s just looking for a negative really ,0
5376, L italiano restaurant was pretty poor which is a shame because the hotel was wonderful but other than that it was brilliant ,0
5377, hair dryer doesnt work i can ise just once if you are booked on booking com They will give worst room in hotel my room hasnt got any view bathroom isnt so bad,0
5378, No body answeing phone so i have to come down for any request I requested city view and i was promised to get it if available but when i reach i discovered that all twin room has inside view which i hoped if they told me before ,0
5379, We pulled out the sofa bed and used the extra blanket which had a large yellow stain on it and the extra pillows had some stains on the pillow casing ,0
5380, Considering the price you ve got to have a room overlooking outside ,0
5381, The fact that the shower flooded the bathroom due to the floor being all one level nice idea in principle but in practice it doesn t work well We had to use some of the towels to dry the floor Also a member of the cleaning staff knocked on our door at about 0830 to see if they could get in to clean the room Checkout wasn t until midday and if we had checked out early then this could have been relayed from reception as to what rooms were ready to clean Disturbed a very rare lie in for my wife and I View from the room was to the inner atrium so all you could see were more rooms This was a shame as being on the 13th floor it would have been nice to have an external window,0
5382, Couldn t alight in front of the hotel as there was road construction blocking the front entrance,0
5383, We were 3 families and had 3 rooms One of the bathrooms had a clogged shower drain which resulted in the bathroom getting flooded and unable to be used The staff was unapologetic rude and refused to change the room They kept saying they would send someone to fix it but refused to understand that the family living there could not use the shower before starting their day They just shrugged their shoulders and had no solution to the immediate problem at hand which was that the guests who had paid to stay in that room had nowhere to shower They used the showers in the other two rooms we had but we lost out on our morning because of the delay The hotel is located in a popular area and is probably always busy so they really don t care The hotel needs to take their maintenance more seriously to avoid such situations They must consider training their staff to deal with such situations if and when required The only good thing was that they had fixed the shower by the time we returned at night ,0
5384, Construction near hotel makes it difficult for Taxi to arrive and depart and even walking road is difficult Not a fault of the hotel though I had requested for early check in but room was not ready which forced me to upgrade the room Hotel did not force situation forced me But the upgrade view was good with London eye Big Ben Westminster Abbey all visible from the room window ,0
5385, We wanted to buy a bottle of wine from the bar but they didn t have any that was cold as apparantly fridges were broken ,0
5386, The location of the twin rooms overlooking the inner courtyard very dark and gloomy this made us change to the next category room which was way better,0
5387, Lots of road works going on having to pay for the Internet also breakfast not included in the price expensive but in a good location ,0
5388,No Negative,0
5389, The bed was uncomfortable The TV was tucked in the corner of the room Front desk staff was unpleasant ,0
5390, A significant drawback was the sliding glass door of the bathroom which meant that anyone using it during the night woke everyone else up with the noise of the sliding door and the bathroom light lit up the rest of the studio very brightly A proper door would give much better privacy to everyone inside and outside the bathroom ,0
5391, Room was small for a superior room and poorly lit especially as it was an inside room and overlooked the inside wall of the hotel No view therefore needed better lighting within Restaurant tables were not well laid and had to go searching for cutlery at breakfast ,0
5392, It might have been useful to know there are roadworks ongoing outside the front entrance This didn t affect me as I was at the back but some customers might have been bothered by the noise ,0
5393, I found that the receptionists although speaking reasonable English were sometimes hard to understand and sometimes it was hard to make them really understand what it was you meant They were however always polite and helpful ,0
5394, house keeping kept the door to the room open after cleaning mattress felt little lumpy elevators take forever to come to the 14th floor esp in the morning maybe good idea to allocate an elevator for the top 3 floors only to avoid the over crowd reception staff are not so friendly even little rude and ignorant ,0
5395, We were there from Friday afternoon until Sunday and our room was not cleaned on the Saturday they did apologise and gave us fresh towels,0
5396, Hotel italian restaurand had automatic 12 5 tip added Small print bottom of receipt and i also left 5 for 56 meal so they got 12 for delivering 2 main courses Failed to mention when i gave extra money Disappointing,0
5397, Extractor fan in bathroom was on constantly irratating noise when trying to sleep Room was too hot air con was not working as it should ,0
5398, Dealt with above ,0
5399, The only complaint unfortunately was the restaurant area which is nowhere near enough to cater for the number of guests breakfast in particular where the queues at peak times are huge and led to us missing breakfast our second day which we d paid for The warnings are very clear to be fair to avoid peak times but this isn t really the point everyone should be catered for correctly and be able to choose when they want to eat ,0
5400, The room which we had was meant to be a family room the bed was fine but the children had a sofa bed which was the noisey as hell any time the kids moved in there sleep If squeaked so much ,0
5401, the bed was not that comfortable and the temperature of the room was very hot even when the gauge was set to low,0
5402, Food in the bar could have been improved I would have liked more choices for breakfast ,0
5403, The bathroom was a wet room but unfortunately when using the shower water spread across the whole of the floor so you could not use the other facilities until it had drained away which took at least half an hour ,0
5404, The drinks were slightly pricey but you have to expect that in London anyway ,0
5405, Staff at check out were a little inexperienced but always polite and trying their best,0
5406, The promised sauna steam room were not working I phoned the reception they said they were but when I went down they weren t and I wasted half an hour out of a tight schedule needlessly They also didn t respond to my complaint about it Very disappointing ,0
5407, We had a drink in the outside veranda at around 23 00 At 10 00 the following day our empty glasses were still where we had left them and the ashtrays were still overflowing Gives a very poor first impression as this is next to the entrance ,0
5408, The biggest thing is the lifts always when to top floor first and make its way down when it got to our level the lift was full most of the time making us wait longer for a lift ,0
5409, More space between the door and the bed but that was a very minor issue Road works made walking a bit roundabout but nothing to do with the hotel ,0
5410, See above,0
5411, The bed and pillows are very soft which i did not like Also they need a good maintenance for the room facility and i wish if they can change the white lights with yellow lights to get the modern look of the room just an opinion ,0
5412, I felt the bathroom could be a little cleaner Because the chrome in the bathroom was not polished up by that I mean just a wipe over with a micro fibre cloth it made me look closer and the bathroom shower cubicle especially taps ect could of been cleaner it was a shame that something so simple let it down for me ,0
5413, smell of drains sewer in bathroom brekfast too crowded tables too close and knocked by people children pushing past hotel not received booking regarding children,0
5414, Room was a little small and the room window looked at the inside of the hotel,0
5415, There wasn t anything we did not like this was our 3rd visit to this hotel and it has been great each time we have stayed ,0
5416, Loads of roadworks around entrance made access on foot tricky Couple of sidelights in room did not work Shower controls a bit of a mystery ,0
5417, Stayed 4 days with my family for the London Marathon Not a good experience The hotel is always crowded and not relaxing Rooms as soon as you enter in a small dark and narrow room near the door you find the bed In the middle there s a small bathroom and kitchenette and near the window another small room with a sofa additional bed Satellite TV always bad signal so you find all the channels available but it is almost impossible to watch a programme without freezing and video problems interruptions The first sign that you see whan you arrive tells that guests have to expect long queues for breakfast and it is true Queues for everything breakfast in the weekends check in elevators The queue for breakfast was the worst one considering that I was with my parents who had to wait 15 mins standing before sitting Inaccurate room cleaning One day room was made at 16 00 the next day they didn t refurbish toilet paper and soap The next one they didn t remove used glasses and dishes The first day they started to knock at the door for service at 8 in the morning with people still in the room Breakfast room cold and inadeguate for the dimensions of this huge hotel Staff not very professional and trained with some exceptions Location near Waterloo station in front of the hotel there is a bus parking so when you are outside waiting for a taxi it is always complicate Beside road works in the street so noise and long alternative routes to cross the street To find some bars Overall this hotel was a terrible choice ,0
5418, We booked the restaurant in evening and when we went to pay we asked if we could split the bill as we were with friends and we had our son so ours was more and we were told it would take to much time and he was to busy to do it and we would have to do it ourselves so we then had to go off to one side and get our phones out to work it out for him We paid a lot to stay there and brought another 2 couples with us and I just felt his attitude was not in keeping with a restaurant and hotel like that and I would think twice about dining there again Other than that the other staff were lovely and helpful especially the concierge who was so friendly and helpful ,0
5419, I did not like breakfast at all Except the omletes cooked by chief Restoran for the breakfast very small so creates long waiting list in front of restaurant ,0
5420, Not happy with the service in the Italian resteraunt very slow Automatic service charge added even though it took over 2 hours for 2 course meal of which the one of the courses was a cold starter People that were seated after us were served preferentially,0
5421, The room is a bit dated The fridge is a bit too small since a large part of it was locked ,0
5422, The double room was very small with two twin beds and very little room Given the price this was not worth it The breakfast was nice but cost additional 20 pounds per person Also requested a 1 hour late check out and was charged an additional 10 pounds per room Seemed unnecessary ,0
5423, At peak times the queue line for breakfast could be long but either the family room would be open additional seating upstairs or the line would move fairly quickly ,0
5424, I wouldn t recommend this location for travelers with cars as parking is difficult and the London Congestion Charge is prohibitive The breakfast lines were a little long but the staff managed very well and kept everyone happy and the breakfast was good ,0
5425, Room cleaning could be improved ,0
5426, Upon arrival our superior twin room was very disappointing No external view as requested even though I know not guaranteed Our room which overlooked internal diners was very dark and hot during the night so no other choice except to sleep with the air con on which is not ideal Had it stated upon booking that there was limited rooms with an external view I would not have booked this hotel as for the price you can stay elsewhere that has an external view A nice few days spent in London however would not stay at this hotel again ,0
5427, Very tricky getting a reasonable gluten free breakfast despite putting it in the details and phoning ahead Took 3 attempts to get something and several incorrect rounds of information being given despite a 3 year old being coeliac and waiting patiently for his gluten free food Balcony was lovely but it appeared to be the only one missing outside seating which is a missed opportunity given the view Room was a little tired and worn decor wise but a fab size ,0
5428,No Negative,0
5429, Could hear people walking about the floor,0
5430, Room I booked was small and dark with no outside window In my opinion it was misrepresented on booking com We would not have been happy there for 5 days ,0
5431, Have stayed previously and room was excellent This time it was far too hot even after the maintenance had attended Had to keep curtains closed as air con couldn t keep the room at normal temp ,0
5432, Breakfast although nice and plenty of choice was far too expensive cheaper and better choice at local restaurants and bars,0
5433, It took some time for the cleaning service to do the daily cleaning,0
5434, Air conditioning noisy no ventilation room to hot Room service meal only warm Breakfast disappointing queuing for table then table reset as collecting self service meal Selfservice meal warm mushrooms and tomatoes cold ,0
5435, Had to alert maintenance twice on issues which housekeepers should have picked up on and rectified before my arrival Faulty lamp in bedroom and faulty shower head This was POOR Both issues were resolved swiftly and efficiently upon request however Had to alert reception that I was being charged for breakfast on both nights of my stay as my rate quoted was inclusive of breakfast This was POOR ,0
5436, I purchased the breakfast package but there was limited seating and a long line for breakfast We ate there twice and it was fine but I was disappointed not to be able to take advantage of something I had paid for ,0
5437, Strange definition of city view we could only see the rails of waterloo station Poor breakfast service queuing for 45 minutes before gettting a table in a conference room Being obliged to watch children movie on a big screen while having breakfast Poor quality of food especially bread We had to call the reception every day to have a complete towel set ,0
5438, Please clean the windows Since there where so many kids staying at the hotel there should be an entertainment room for them The breakfast room is too small and is a pity that there isn t i a coffee machine ,0
5439, Standing in line each morning for breakfast was poor not enough tables to support hotel Seemed to stand forever waiting on lifts to and from room level Prices in bar where over the top and had the cheek to charge me 12 5 service charge serving me a beer over the bar ,0
5440, Warmer welcome would ve been better Appreciate 3 tired dirty but polite workmen walk in to reception may offend But think my money is as good as anyone elses Breakfast was poor especially grey bacon left in bains marie or combi too long Plaza opposite Westminster Bridge much better,0
5441, The breakfast buffet area was too small We were disappointed about no pool ,0
5442, The elevators are so slow and everyone is upset about it Every morning there is a long waiting line for breakfast very frustrating to wait about 20 min for a table ,0
5443, Overall the stay at Park Plaza County Hall met my expectations The only inconvenience was the lifts It felt like you were waiting quite a while for lifts to call at your floor ,0
5444, Parents room quite small no view they were looking into middle of hotel bathrooms could be improved very big step to get over into bath and no lock on bathroom doors ,0
5445, Room was probably a bit smaller than expected and the staff were generally very good breakfast area was a bit crowded and the breakfast tables and seats were very close together breakfast service was a bit hap hazard particularly when queueing for eggs,0
5446, one of the hotel stuff ruined our bag by mistake they didnt offer any compensation,0
5447,No Negative,0
5448, Restaurant is very unexciting and feels a bit like a cafeteria Bar area unexciting too Felt this was a shame as did not encourage use of either ,0
5449, City view through Waterloo railway not nice at all limited number of adapters available at reception early breakfast recommended or longer waiting time ,0
5450,No Negative,0
5451, Breakfast was average with some of the food a bit bland Lifts were terrible and expected better but overall a good stay,0
5452, The breakfast option seemed good but we didn t book it as it was too expensive per person Perhaps more pricing options would have encouraged us to take breakfast in the hotel ,0
5453, the breakfast is so basic for its price The food assortment is very limited for the price of 20 pounds I can go and have much better breakfast in the cafe I also recommend to come earlier for the breakfast because the restaurant is not big and possibly you will have to wait for the table,0
5454, there was no welcome water bottled at the room and there was no black tea in the mini bar the TV is located in one side and it hard to watch TV from the other bed side ,0
5455, Room 1024 and the filthy windows which were so dirty you couldn t see out of them Staff were happy to show us alternatives but perhaps it would be better to employ a window cleaner ,0
5456, We were able to hear our neighbours which was a bit offputting Also we could hear the restaurant noise as it was directly below us We didn t take advantage of the breakfast which we were glad of as the queue for breakfast was very long at 8 30 am ,0
5457, Wardrobe inside light was not going off when closing the doors so was lit all night Poor views from our room though just used it for overnight mostly WIFI poor speed ,0
5458, Rooms were sometimes not made during the day Restaurant was not big enough to cope with breakfast,0
5459, This room was not worth 200 night I believe that the Premier Inn adjacent to this hotel would have offered a more comfortable room with better bathroom facilities The amount of space around the bed offered little chance of decent movement around the room The wardrobe was inadequate in size to offer enough clothing storage space for 2 room guests The bathroom sliding glass door could only be fully closed using great force is liable to break should a strong young man use such force In this case it could result in that person sustaining injury I would suggest that you use this tiny room as a storeroom ,0
5460, Room cleaning was great when they did it But there were a couple days we came back from being gone all day and they hadn t gotten to our room yet Not a big deal but worth mentioning,0
5461,No Negative,0
5462, Breakfast could have been better coffee was very poor on the 3 mornings ,0
5463, Some of the bathroom towels were frayed and worn looking ,0
5464, The cost was a bit too expensive but considering the location I ll make an exception The noise of people opening and closing doors was immense Also the sound of water running through the pipes from upstairs was very loud It was evident everytime someone flushed the toilet The sound proofing needs a bit of work to say the least Lack of USB chargers in a modern hotel is questionable ,0
5465, The fact that you couldnt open the windows unless you was on pent house level was misleading I did not like this at all THe temperature in the room was constantly boiling even if heater was off I asked to move room and turned out I couldnt as none of them have windows Not good ,0
5466, Reception for my mobile phone,0
5467, A picture is worth a thousand words Added photos are not taken from a construction site this is central London and what you see through your window if you can after paying about 200euros per night in a 4 star hotel not like the amazing photos on the website right Needless to say the view is accompanied by construction noises starting at 7 30 am in the working days Sure they do have double glazed glasses but I am a very light sleeper and requested an upper storey room for this reason in my reservation Seems no one reads or cares what is written there In the room there was no coffee machine as declared on the booking com website the hot water pressure was so low that a quick shower took ages Housekeepers knocked our door two times by mistake as they thought we need additional sheets or a sofa bed After all yes the room was clean excluding the muddy windows and spacious but the rest was enough to ruin our anniversary We will never step in Park Plaza again even if it is the only hotel in town and I will make sure that this outstanding quality will be seen and known by as many as other people so that same cannot happen to them ,0
5468, We had an internal view quite disconcerting Would have requested to change it had we stayed longer,0
5469, It was very very pricey to stay here The breakfast on day 2 had a long line and it did not seem that they had an organized plan to seat people for breakfast ,0
5470, I wish the staff could speak better English I found it very difficult at times to be understood and for them to understand me and the food and everything was nice but the service could have been faster I m not sure why waiting staff didn t think to come back after they ve dropped your meal to see if you would like something else or tea coffee dessert etc A small thing but annoying ,0
5471, Because we stayed six days and ate the breakfast on site every day because we paid for the included breakfast it would have been nice if they had changed up the menu from one day to the next It would have been really great if they had offered French Toast pancakes or waffles sigh But that said we had no problem with being seated right away as some reviewers have And the food was fresh and hot with plenty available ,0
5472, The room size was smalle the temperature in room very hot there is no buses or tubes stations neer from hotel The waterloo station 10min walking from the hotel The hotel doesn t provide room dining 24 hours and just one restaurant in the hotel which is italian restaurant ,0
5473, The rooms was not big enough for 2 or 3 persons We asked for 3 beds but did only get 1 bed and 1 crap sofa The WC dosen t have a proper door so there is no privacy ,0
5474, Hard to find anything wrong My single room was tiny but this is normal for Central London ,0
5475, HD TV was confusing and I am not convinced was working properly That is ITV1 continually showed a Sky trailer I could not get any ITV1 programs TV guide was also not working ,0
5476, The shower didn t work and wasn t looked at until the 2nd evening of our 2 night stay after we spoke to reception the afternoon of our day of arrival the following morning and afternoon The room was incredibly hot despite also informing reception of this on the 3 occasions we complained about the shower We were told the room temperature was controlled by computer and that it would be adjusted This was never done I was also given a discount card and told I could use this for a 5 discount on the hotel bar and restaurants When I purchased a rum and ginger at the bar I was told this discount was for soft drinks only and charged the full 9 90 for my drink that s not a typo it was nearly 10 ,0
5477, Nothing ,0
5478, 1 Frontdesk is soso I asked for an adampter wehn I checked in and was told I have to come tomorrow morning 9 00am When I came eary in the following moring they said it is first come first get and dont have any So I have to buy one in B1 Suggest the hotel to tell the client clearly what you can help and if you can t let us know as well 2 The price is higher compared with its service ,0
5479, The underground Waterloo is very busy between 8 30 9 00 am we had to wait for six trains before we could ride along in a cart stuck like sardines in a can We arrived at the wrong chain reception showed us no smile at all didnt appoligized that we are at the wrong location She just did not care at all But this is the case in all London hotels I ve noticed Specially with the east European staff members Their accent showed through The sighing especially so rude Spending 200 a night should not give this service at all most annoying point was that we mentioned that we want a business invoice and mentioned it on booking com but they refuse to give us ons Only after consulting the manager we were granted what we wanted As a business traveler this is not convenient and very time consuming and annoying ,0
5480, Our superior twin room was small and dark overlooking a narrow internal courtyard which meant that we had to have the light on at all times of day Not very comfortable and not good value ,0
5481, I requested a higher floor room but assigned a 1st floor room In the room the door s inside key was broken so could not lock The bed was terribly hard and I had a backache next day ,0
5482,No Negative,0
5483, The airconditioner was warm and I found out just on the last night when I asked for a fan that the temps can be dropped by the staff It would have been nice to know that is advance pre authorization on your CC is needed in advance if u want to order room service Should be part of the initial CC pre authorization I shouldn t be paying each time I order something ,0
5484, Not much to complain about perhaps the price but then again given the position ,0
5485,No Negative,0
5486, The burger was a bit scary Other in our group had the chicken burger which was ok I requested a late check out the night we checked in The receptionist said to call in the morning a charge of 10pnds an hour I called in the morning at 8AM to arrange the late check out only to be told it was now not ok they need the room After that there were 5 phone calls through out the morning up until 11 30 A little funny they were desperate for this room and we had to experience 5 hang ups through out the morning not relaxing knowing they want you out as soon as possible ,0
5487, Nothing couldn t find fault with anything Didn t like not having time to use the spa ,0
5488,No Negative,0
5489, There is nothing I didn t like you would have to be a very miserable person to complain about park plaza county hall,0
5490, Had to wait 3 hours for our room Ordered delivery and had to go downstairs in my pajamas to get it The shower water overflowed into the kitchenette area and then all the way into the bedroom Our entire room was soaked The room was freezing the entire time despite the heat being on the maximum level ,0
5491, The sofa bed was hard The pillows were far to soft and useless as when you put your head on them they disappeared and gave no support bring your own Room far to stuffy and hot air con made it hotter if stayed longer would have complained about heat,0
5492, Children s sofa bed was very uncomfortable Frosted glass bathroom door didn t afford much privacy ,0
5493, No milk in room for drinks Shower unable to regulate temperature Although I asked for twin as I stayed with my son the 2 beds were positioned too close like a double bed Much too tired to complain that evening as we were late checking in and just wanted to sleep,0
5494, I booked reservation fee days before arriving date After I checked in I found the price was dropped a lot However booking still charged me the original price I booked I hope booking is able to alert customer Wht the recent price is ,0
5495, I had to wait for my room to be ready even though I d arrived late afternoon and also I had to wait for a table at breakfast ,0
5496, N A,0
5497, Didn t like coming home because had a great time ,0
5498, Valet parking should be cheaper hourly rates which then would create more business UK needs to adopt free valet parking and get away from the system what is deemed as luxurious and get with the times ,0
5499, A solid door on the in room bathroom instead of a sliding frosted glass door Had to pay for wifi ,0
5500, When I booked I requested a room on a high floor with good view We got a room overlooking a building site The hotel said you had not forwarded this request I was very disappointed as I had booked last year Felt let down ,0

5503, Nothing Overall an amazing hotel ,0
5504, Room was a bit small for 2 adults and 2 children not much room to move around in My husband requested a special children s pack for my daughters birthday which included ice cream and it arrived much later and all melted left in our room Also when they removed it and we requested another one it took almost an hour I had also informed the hotel it was my daughters birthday but nothing special was done about this If it wasn t for my husband paying extra for the kids package we could have been at any hotel ,0
5505, No complaints,0
5506, Rooms facing the lift suffer severely from the noise of the safety locking mechanism I relocated Wifi throughput erratic TV cables and remote had been removed by an earlier guest helpful and well meaning but not very efficient staff took 2 days to fix this Spa sauna steam room tiny have to ask for facilities to be switched on For 240 per night I would have expected the breakfast to involve something like an omelette without surcharge Little things like lights hinges taps would benefit from some adjustments ,0
5507, Rooms too hot at night ambient temperature too high and felt putting air conditioning on in March a waste of money and not very environmentally friendly ,0
5508,No Negative,0
5509, The walk in shower was not well designed Water went everywhere every time you had a shower However it wasn t a major problem ,0

5523, the breakfast was lovely with plenty of option just the scrambled egg was nasty very rubbery and bland,0
5524, Wasn t happy with the main shower head not working properly coming out at different angles and water ended up on the ceiling and the floor making it very dangerous to walk on,0
5525, The sofa bed was not that clean so I phoned the reception asking for cleaning the bed and the cleaning staff came but they were not nice I waited for the lift for around 15 mins 3 lifts are not enough ,0
5526, Shower Bath water was cold called reception several times and nothing was sorted Came in on Saturday night and the staff on reception was so close with each other flirting and touching each other made me feel so uncomfortable The room wasn t cleaned even though we left the sign on the door I feel disappointed with the stay when paying so much money I would like to be able to be in contact with manager As I would like a refund ,0
5527, breakfast was not included and really should had been for the price i paid ,0
5528, When we arrived our city view consisted of the train station next to the hotel Asked for a room with a proper city view and the only available room was the penthouse at cost Decided to upgrade and it was worth every penny ,0
5529, Carpet was a little shabby and bathroom had seen better days but these are not cheap or easy fixes The room was internal and the only window faced onto the Restaurant so there was no natural light Not a problem for me pitch black makes me sleep like the dead but my sister wasn t keen But for only 2 nights it was perfectly liveable ,0
5530, Just need reception staff to work on their grasp of understanding the customer It took a few attempts to make myself clear,0

5532, I made a book at booking for two adult and one 10 year old when coming to the hotel I had to pay extra for the child Not OK,0
5533, Lack of parking mitigated by valet service which however costs 45 for 24 hours which might put off some people ,0
5534, Lack of extra pillows Our room smelt when we first went into it wasn t pleasant We waited 15 minutes for a lift and ended up taking the stairs Our room keys kept failing to let us in our room we must of had them re programmed 4 times When we returned to our room about 11pm there were children playing football in the lift area near the restaurant which I thought was really bad as no staff seemed to be stopping them I requested early book in but was not given this although they stored our bags for us which helped I wouldn t stop here again for money we paid ,0

5540, Service completely incompetent Unhelpful Only room service staff knew what to do The rooms were dirty The amount of dust in the wardrobe was shocking I have never seen something like that in Ta room which costs 250 a night in central London ,0
5541, I was in room 1224 I think and the elevator outside clicks and clocks like a gun every 5 10 minutes But shabby to be honest I don t like gun s I am comparing your hotel to the park plaza Victoria in Amsterdam That hotel is top banana ,0
5542, Would have liked a table and a second chair in the room Because the settee was used as a bed for our stay we hadn t enough furniture to relax on ,0
5543, Sofa Bed uncomfortable for children short wait for a table at breakfast ,0
5544, Queue for breakfast although it was only 5 mins it s hard with young children,0
5545, The gym equipment was OK but not as high standard as the rest of the hotel however it had a gym which is unusual for a London hotel in this price range ,0
5546, Everything else I booked an executive studio room and upgraded to city view the other week The stay was for myself and my parents I havent seen them in a long time and it was meant to be a family weekend out before I get married Firstly booking com has advertised the room I was booking with a picture of the room with a view to London Eye or Big Ben Did we get that view Not at all And we could barely get in the room as the sofa bed was so close to the door My mom is disabled so I went to the reception and told them that they must have gotten the room incorrect So they changed our room to a Junior Suite which just had a window overlooking the waterloo train station I have told one of the staff members that we upgraded on booking com and had to have a view to Big ben or London eye which they said is not their fault and theres the Shard building somewhere far away that we can slightly see and because the Shard is in the city this is the City view You can say that pretty much about anything I appreciate they changed our room to a bigger one until I realised that the Spa bookings I have made for myself and my mother have not been made Complained to the reception they said its not their fault again and they can try and fit one of us in at some point during our stay There were missing bulbs in pretty much every lamp in the room my moms duvet had a blood stain on have photo proof I have also requested to have an extra duvet as my parents dont like sharing one had to ask twice although it was written in the notes The next morning after the room was cleaned the extra duvet was gone again I have never had a worse stay in a hotel in my life ,0
5547, We are a family of 4 on arrival first day complementary toiletries not enough had to call house keeping for more Second day was out most of the day sight seeing got back at 5 15 room just cleaned left us with 2 towels only no toiletries had to ring house keeping again ,0
5548, Found the bed for the children very uncomfortable it was a pull out sofa bed Unfortunately they didn t sleep very well We had a studio room with a different layout on this occasion the rooms were only partitioned with a desk and pillar rather than the bathroom which makes it more practical so it wasn t as seperate as we would have liked and as easy for them to get to sleep unless we turned our lights off too might be worth requesting this with the hotel ,0
5549,No Negative,0
5550, The fact that the restaurant shows you special deals but they don t actually offer it you I found the room freezing even after turning air con off and switched to warm and the fact that I paid extra to have breakfast in bed and they only brought my husbands breakfast and forgot my porridge and only came back to say they had forgotten it as we was about to check out so I paid for breakfast as a package and then extra for room service and never recieved it and never got a refund ,0
5551, The key cards weren t that great found ourself standing there for ages to try and get in to our room also the room was very hot Even with the aircon on lowest temp so didn t sleep that great,0
5552, Breakfast Area often overcrowded room requires some maintenance Carpet Soap Holder in Shower House Keeping was often done relatively late ,0
5553, A little busy so had to queue for breakfast but was half term and guidance is given on busy times Ate breakfast in ground floor bar area on second day but food was a little cold ,0
5554, Staff at the reception wasn t helphul at all Was asked to pay although had paid for the stay the evening before After explaining my situation she requested a different card Being not very fluent in English I couldn t properly defend my position after what she asked my nationality and told me you can go Very surprised that a central London hotel can be so rude and insensitive Deep disappointment and unpleasant feeling for the rest of the day ,0
5555, We booked a studio with a double and sofa bed The sofa bed is so bad I literally went to a e with severe neck pain Do not sleep on the sofa bed Also very surprised that no Ow came to clean the room until 6 pm We had been out since 8am ,0
5556, Limited channels at TV Limited sugar for tea hahaha And very limited milk It was not which we was expected for the value which we paid,0
5557, Useless staff in Bar We had to ask five times if we could order drinks Each time they said they would take our order at our table The final time we insisted they took our order at the Bar but still no one made any effort to organise drinks It wasn t busy I have no idea why the four staff were unable to provide an adequate service It was bizarre ,0
5558, Your staff did not know where to pool is and instructed me to visit the neighboring park plaza building to be humiliated when I asking if I have my room card and if I am a resident The talk continued for 10 minutes where every service which I originally came for was not available Hence this hotel although modern and pricy is nothing more than a unorganized scam But good job you took my money you are good capitalists,0
5559, The rooms have no windows and very much dislike the air conditioning The rooms are too hot and not comfortable which meant I didn t sleep until 3am You can hear the lifts all night and they are noisy and I m a light sleeper Also every time I ve been to the hotel my room is never ready much preferred the park plaza hotel across the road ,0
5560, Room was too hot could not get the temperature down,0
5561, The rooms were not ready on time at 2pm The queue for breakfast Not complaints just points to note ,0
5562, A couple of little niggles Fridge part of the minibar wasn t cold enough and the room was too warm despite having the air con on max Perhaps it being so cold out meant they turned the heating up ,0
5563, The temperature of the hotel our room wouldn t warm up even after putting the temperature to max Also the microwave wasn t present in the room as was expected to be included ,0
5564, Queuing for the restaurant at breakfast On checking out at midday decided to have a coffee in the bar area but the staff were still clearing away tables from breakfast Seemed to be in no great rush This wasn t the case when I last visited last year,0
5565, Paid for upgrade to see London Eye Big Ben Eye was fab view couldn t see Big Ben did complain and got half of upgrade fee back if you want to see Big Ben too need higher than 7th floor Also for price we paid would have been nice to have breakfast included An additional 20 a head didn t seem fair when spending over 200 on a room ,0
5566, Shower creates a bit of a puddle as the door didn t shut properly,0
5567, I paid for an executive suite with city view as it stated on the website What I got was a room on the 11 th floor overlooking the side of the Park Plaza Westminster across the road and part of the construction site from Waterloo train station Very unhappy about this I was told at reception I could look forward to a great view from my room the windows were filthy to so good luck taking any photos of your stunning view James quirk,0
5568, Minor things that I wouldn t even put the hotel down over it was our personal preference ,0
5569,No Negative,0
5570, Room was a little too hot even when air con was in cold,0
5571, Additional beds for kids sofa bed was very uncomfortable and smelled because of humidity Air conditioning was bad too no fresh air can be found inside building ,0
5572, Staff rather rude and dismissive on check in which was nt a great start after a long journey Check out was lengthy so opted to drop keys in the Express Box Bedroom layout was odd TV in front to dresser instead of a mirror That was on the inside of the wardrobe door which then had to be left open which wasnt ideal Room was SO hot air con had no effect and no window could be opened Bathroom door is frosted glass and faces the bed so no matter how comfortable you and your partner are is still really not good Little confusing as there are 2 Park Plazas next to each other Food Drink is dear but its London so Nothing close for a drink unless you walk to the Southbank which we did but everywhere closed around 9 30 so hotel has a captive audience as it were Overall a nice but pricey stay ,0
5573, check in staff not helpful lobby small and therefore always crowded Breakfast room feels like a fast food restaurant Far too small when hotel is full especially with families They call it executive rooms although there was no executive lounge Elevators too slow for number of guests Have stayed often in London but this was the least appealing hotel There are certainly many better options ,0
5574, Poor cleanliness very bad Wifi connection The bed is uncomfortable it really hurts my back and nick Very slow service Breakfast asking for extra money to get something like omelet So I cancelled,0
5575, Danish pastries croissants at breakfast were cold would have been nice if warm or if there was a way to heat up,0
5576, The only thing I didn t like was the fact that I had to come home ,0
5577, We paid for Internet and the tv kept says No signal so we were unable to use it Other than that our experience was amazing We would definitely visit again ,0
5578, Dressing gowns were tatty and too small Towels too looked a little tired Bed seemed hot due to plastic cover ,0
5579, Not enough lifts which means if you are on one of the upper floors then be prepared for waiting up to 5 minutes for one to arrive ,0
5580, 20 30 min queue to get to breakfast both Saturday and Sunday we did not arrive at the same time is not acceptable to a 4 star hotel Our room was not cleaned after the first night until we asked for it around 5 30 in the afternoon ,0
5581,No Negative,0
5582, Breakfast had to queue for about 20 minutes and then when we did sit down had to queue again for hot food which wasnt being replenished very quickly so choices were limited not good value,0
5583, The duvet It was too thick heavy and very lumpy Made sleeping uncomfortably hot ,0
5584, The most awful hotel that i have ever lived in The staffs were not friendly and nobody helped us with our luggages when we checked in till we asked The heating in the room was either extremely too hot or too cold We couldnt adjust the temperature in our room We had to call to the reception to let people do it over and over again We stayed there for three nights and none of the nights were comfy Definitely not worth for the money that we paid Very disappointed We would not choose this hotel again and we are not recommend this hotel to anyone ,0
5585, Overpriced for New Years eve paid 400 per room per night and when asked if we could have a room facing the fireworks they wanted another 800 per night Total extortion dirty small and below average room Wouldn t pay more than 40 a night Had to take 3 small children outside to watch in the freezing cold at 11 30pm because they would not let us have a room facing the fireworks Rooms were empty because people refused to pay 800 they wanted ,0
5586, Leave ahead at least a day for your laundry cos the dryer will take at least 2 rounds 2 5 hours per round to do your clothes half dry ,0
5587, The room wasn t ready when we arrived at 4 00pm Our room should have been available 2 00pm The sofa bed was not very comfortable ,0
5588, The beds were way too soft to my liking the shower switch wasn t working housekeeping seemed to forget their items in the room for 2 nights I stayed there ,0
5589, Arrived a little early for check in and the room wasn t ready they took our bags and said I would be contacted by Txt message when room was available no sign of a text by 1 30 PM so called up to the desk and room was ready room was small fixtures and fittings were poor tap was falling off the sink ,0
5590, At fisrt the sofa bed was broken but we get change to another room,0
5591, We were a group of friends and the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable you could feel the springs through the mattress,0
5592, We were 2 parents and child The added fold up bed was positioned where you would expect the fixed bed to be and vice versa The elevators seem to be insufficient for the large number of rooms When checking out it was very difficult to actually make it down to recepcion because every time the elevator passed it was already full with people And no matter how nice a hotel might be when it s time to go it s time to go ,0
5593, Response to queries I didn t get any Requested a room with a view when booking and in a follow up email as it was the first time in London for my children Appreciate it may not always be possible but just didn t get any response Also asked for information about family activities on follow up email as this is mentioned on the website again no response Disappointing ,0
5594, We had to wait around two hours after the time you could check in because our room wasn t ready ,0
5595, the bed is not comfortable the breakfast is always crowded limited options opposite to what was mentioned we had to wait for in long ques for a table for breakfast sometimes we were offered to have have breakfast in conference meeting rooms in another floor so as not to wait we were told that the breakfast is the same which was not as there was items in the main restaurant but not where we had our breakfast however they played cartoons which was amusing for the kids ,0
5596, Didnt like that although featured in promotional pictures there was no way the London Eye could be seen from anywhere in the hotel Also that the bathroom sink was blocked The burgers we ordered from room service came with no condiments No Ketchup in the burgers or as compliments and that it took room service another 25 mins instead of the couple they promised to brings some by which time we had eaten the burgers to prevent them getting cold Very Poor Also the pasta in the Italian restaurant was poor and our we were given an additional dish we did not order ,0
5597, There were no face wash cloths provided this was a challenge No onsite variety store selling basic vacation items such as varied drinks confectionery items vacation supplies likely to be required ,0
5598, The room Inside room with view of the dining room Could not open the window Could not control the air conditioning Was advised the morning after our stay that we needed to ask reception if we needed cold air as it was controlled from downstairs The tap on the bathroom sink was very loose The tap on the bath was very stiff the setting was programmed for hand shower use so my friend got quite a surprise soaking when she tried to turn on the shower and one of the turning spikes handle broke off in my hand when I tried to turn it Could not control the water temperature so ended up filling the bath from the hand shower unit with boiling water and taking a bath when the water cooled down Advised reception of the issues after breakfast and 2 plumbers came up to the room straight away where they proceeded to tighten the sink tap and look at the shower bath controls Both agreed that they were not right They also pointed out that there was no visibility of the hot cold bath shower info on the taps as this appeared to have rubbed off We spoke to the manager who offered to refund our breakfast but not the cost of the room Cannot fault the staff polite and efficient but a little disappointed that no refund part refund was offered The front of house manager gave us his card and advised me to email these details on our return ,0
5599, There were a few lights in the room that just wouldn t turn off so it was illuminated even during the night Also the wardrobe handle just fell off the first time opening it No major issues though ,0
5600, The shower easily overflowed The mattress topper had gone lumpy ,0
5601, Room was quite cold only air conditioning was available and not needed considering its winter Buffet breakfast was nice but area is too small considering the number of people we saw each morning Luckily with a 6 year old we were early for breakfast only saw queues on leaving Tables very cramped and area cold with lobby doors constantly being opened Small things i noticed were no facecloths in bathroom or cleaning liquid cloth for kitchenette ,0
5602, We were promised a room with bath and kitchen but did not get this There was no kettle even in the room until we requested one We chose this hotel which was not really as convenient as we would have liked specifically for this reason On complaining we were offered our last night in the room we had requested An offer we did not take as it was too late to pack and unpack for one night ,0
5603, Ripped duvet cover Shower was rubbish no more that a trickle We had to queue for breakfast we were located in the bar on the lower floor as the restaurant was extremely busy we had tiny tables and it was was freezing not happy about this at all ,0
5604,No Negative,0
5605, 1 Food choices of breakfast are too limited,0
5606, Reception staff We paid in full upon arrival and got charged the entire amount 3 times again They were argumentative and refused to believe us so we had to show them our account statement We also got charged small random amounts each day and there were 8 extra things on our mini bar bill that we didn t have It was lucky we checked the charges They refused to be at all apologetic or seem empathetic ,0
5607, Room was very compact for 2 people If we had been a hurry to get out it is difficult for 2 people to not keep running up against each other The big heavy glass sliding door on the bathroom was noisy to move ,0
5608, I have stayed in this hotel many times but on this occasion I got one of the smaller rooms Didn t like the glass door on bathroom ,0
5609, Room felt slightly damp ,0
5610, I was a little put off by the style of the bathroom door translucent glass slider because it didn t allow for as much privacy as I would like I also wished they had mentioned at check in that you use your key card to activate the light switches because it took us a few minutes to figure that out when we got in Maybe they said it and we missed it ,0
5611, The advertising pictures of the hotel make it look very nice but much different when you experience it yourself The Check in was delayed by about 15 minutes yet had to go up a second time asking about when will we be given the key to the room Very poor check in and unproffessional No sink in the room had to use water from the toilet sink to boil the water There is no toothpaste in the bathrooms to brush your teeth with The access to the internet on the tv is blocked Very dissapointed can find much better hotels for the same price ,0
5612, Toiletries were a bit scarce 1 bottle of each for a family of 4 is a bit too little had to ask housekeeping for more every time which they provided with no problems,0
5613, Nothing ,0
5614, More choice of films on tv,0
5615,No Negative,0
5616, Ground coffee and a biscuit would have made it better ,0
5617, Booked for New Year s Eve spent 2660 for two rooms two nights because told London eye view London eye view bull had to go outside and stand in street after bought tickets home page shows London eye they wanted another 2000 pound to upgrade shocking,0
5618, Booked executive suite with view but the view we got was rail way station which was a bit disappointing Was hoping for river eye view Also there were 3 of us staying there but only given 2 cups wine glasses etc and when we called room service reception to request another glass we were told it was on its way but never arrived ,0
5619, the staff were a little slow but vert polite so no faults ,0
5620, We ordered room service after waiting an hour for it they missed the milk for our tea and the pizza Base was doughy We were left to it at breakfast and had nearly finished before we managed to get some ones attention for a warm drink Then they only brought us one and not two When checking out we never got the option or chance to give any feedback about our stay ,0
5621, The amenities in the room such as plates and utensils are not properly washed before being placed back in the cupboard The bathroom sink was clogged the first day we came in The bed is not very comfortable back support is not adequate There is not enough room for breakfast,0
5622, Literally no wardrobe space We stayed for 4 nights and had to leave our clothes in suitcase Not sure it was value for money over New Years Eve The hotel decided to charge 109 00 for the buffet in restaurant on New Years Eve which I felt was cashing in on the whole event They wanted to charge an extra 700 for view upgrade which I thought was cashing in Bar very small no where to relax once a few families are in the bar ,0
5623,No Negative,0
5624, When we booked hotel back in Jan 16 we requested room with a view of London eye In November had email to say our room did not have a view We could upgrade for 300 a night Unfortunately we could not cancel booking without loosing full amount So we had no choice We were on Level 4 and waited on average 20 30 minutes for 1 of 4 lifts Really bad On arrival we were offered Breakfast at an additional cost which we agreed on First morning there was a que of about 45 minutes for a seat in the dining room Not what I would have expected for this class of hotel ,0
5625, That fact I booked a penthouse suite for New Year s Eve on the basis we had a view of the London eye based on the images used booking com On arrival we were advised that our room was south facing meaning we had no view of the fireworks what so ever,0
5626, There seems to be some miscommunication between this hotel and Booking com We arrived on Christmas day and the hotel was fully booked Upon arrival it turned out that we were allocated two rooms on two separate floors even though I specifically indicated we require either a suite or two connected rooms as we have four little children I even received an email confirmation from the hotel s reservation center for this The staff at the front desk was super very nice and they did their best to solve the issue Eventually they upgraded us to a penthouse at the 14th floor which was great The troubles continued the next day and every day thereafter as my booking for breakfast did not go through either and they had to charge me for each breakfast ,0
5627, Ridiculously overpriced Couldn t cont them on phone number on their website or booking com booking page Staff unfriendly and unhelpful Included breakfast was basic boring and cold Bathroom temperature always set to very high temperature Laundry facilities inadequate we re traveling g for 2 months There for a week and housekeeping room maintenance worse each day Bed not made properly Dirty cups and room service tray left in room plus rubbish Would not recommend this hotel to anyone Email I sent still unanswered ,0
5628, Management is arrogant and unhelpfull Breakfast queues of half an hour way to small restaurant for busy times prebooked and confirmed room not there Reception is eager to add costs ,0
5629, Our check in was delayed 3times as the room wasn t ready the room was small and incredibly bad value for money we have stayed in many London hotels and this is by far the worst the bar was cold due to being located by the front door breakfast was farcical after queuing to get a table on the first day we had no plates out only some cold Sausages available with uncooked tomatoes and warm beans the staff seemed very disinterested in general The friends we were staying with complained and we got the grand compensation of 4 bottles of water from our mini bar reduced from our bill This experience also makes me question the value of using booking com as for over 300 per night we could have booked direct with other far better hotels ,0
5630,No Negative,0
5631, Looks like rooms are not cleaned properly We stayed for four nights On the first evening my son unpacked a book and threw packaging under the bed which I noticed later The teared packaging has not been picked up until we were leaving and I saw it and threw away Not a great evidence of cleaning service ,0
5632, Overpriced hotel Rude check in staff and customer relations Long queue for breakfast area was too small for the amount of people Bar staff put in doubles when didn t ask for them so were charged twice the price Will NEVER stay here again BVooking com need to remove this hotel from their website as it is one of the worst i have ever stayed at ,0
5633, Restaurant too small for a full hotel eating breakfast We weren t prepared to wait and went elsewhere Sofa bed a little uncomfortable,0
5634, My 4th but now final stay at the Park Plaza County Hall What has previously been a fine hotel has descended below all expectations 4 night stay in a Studio King Family with plenty of issues 1 Studio King is a lie there is no king bed and reception cheerfully laughed off my complaint on the first day that this was a mis representation 2 Lifts during high occupancy average morning wait on the first floor 10 15mins The lift simply prioritises higher floors every time Yes there are stairs but with a 7 month pregnant wife I shouldn t have to rely on them 3 Breakfast again during high occupancy a disgrace 10 15 mins average wait for a table 4 Temperature control in the room does not work bedroom was a sauna whilst living area was cool 5 Shower Water pressure poor and shower head not properly cleaned with lots of outlets blocked with scum 6 Concierge on checking out did not help with luggage from room despite request link this to pregnant wife and useless lifts after waiting 15 mins I had to carry luggage down stairs with multiple trips as my waiting airport transfer was charging for exceeding permitted waiting time 7 Lobby bar is a nice area providing good value and options of f b but suffered from being too close to the entrance and so was very cold with a constant breeze from people coming and going from the hotel All in all an absolute joke yes I understand hotels struggle during high occupancy but this was simply unacceptable at the rate charged and service expectation What was my go to Central London hotel is now a NEVER AGAIN hotel ,0
5635, The windows didnt open as a result there wasnt enough fresh air into the room and all the smells were kept inside It was extremely hot and there was no way to regulate the air temperature i had to ask twice to switch the heat off at the reception The no of lifts was not enough for all the visitors nor was the no of emploees at the reseption desk Room service food was low quality and very expensive Our room wasnt cleaned every day and the sheets as well The sofa bed for the kids was not confortable we asked for a room in the upper floors with view but we got one in the 4th the hotel has 14 16 floors with no view at all ,0
5636, Beds and pillows were a little hard and the glass sliding door on the toilet offered little privacy should you need it ,0
5637, We had to queue for breakfast It was worth the wait but not what we expected ,0
5638, Most disappointed in the heating system as was unable to turn it up and as we would like to have done to complain at least until occasions we were to Cold most of the time the air conditioning unit would only blow cold and not hot ,0
5639, It is difficult to work the heater in the room It was a cold week ,0
5640, Restaurant seems to be understaffed so service was quite slow Too many new employees probably due to Christmas and they could not answer to questions and provide much help ,0
5641, Unfortunately we did have a slight problem with the ac the thermostat would not work from the room so I had to call front desk and they would control it To be fair they did also send an electric heater to keep the room warm ,0
5642, Some things were in urgent need of repair and attention such as the loose fittings on the shower unit and a corner of the bathroom false wall was breaking away ,0
5643, Dining room is too small for the amount of guests we had to wait longtime before we could sit down Breakfast also needs more variaton ,0
5644, No kettle in the room even though there were tea making facilities I borrowed one from my daughter in the room next door ,0
5645, That the hotel is not the one in the photos but the one across the road with a view of a wall Not 4 ,0
5646, We noticed that the front door of the hotel lets in a lot of cold air you can even feel it in the bar Other than that this hotel is perfect ,0
5647,No Negative,0
5648, Sadly there was no hot water as the boiler had broken but they were working to fix it and did give us a complimentry breakfast,0
5649, The suite was cold The heating was not working it could not be turned up in December ,0
5650, breakfast at 19 50 was disappointing I had room service and food was cold Vegetarian sausages were just veg fingers and not appetising first thing in the morning I suggest quorn or Cauldron sausages Tomatoes not cooked and toast very pale and cold and the Danish pastry was missing Not enough milks sugars for day ,0
5651, The room wasn t ready at check in when we really needed a rest We were given a free drink at the bar though which went some way to compensate ,0
5652, Room had not been made up when we had gone out for the day even thou we told reception we were going out for the day the bath tap shot water out from the side of the filler all over the toilet seat and up the wall the plug in the sink did not work and the shower head water came out from above the shower head it self all got fixed but not the bath filler as found this out on last night taking a bath but did report it so others staying did not have the same problem as we did ,0
5653, For a four star hotel the breakfast was not great and barely better than Premier Inn Watery egg mass produced sausages horrible coffee and fruit juice ,0
5654, We were in a studio adjacent to the atrium Whenever the elevators go up or down there s a loud clanging noise The bedroom is near the door right at the atrium It s not a continuous sound so earplugs were necessary On the second day when checking out I asked if one of the hotel staff would spend the night in our room 702 I believe so they could hear for themselves We got complimentary drinks because of our complaint but the first time we complained no action was taken With the extra topper mattress the bed was reasonably comfortable Beware of the metal leg of the sofabed when folded out ,0
5655,No Negative,0
5656, Booked a family room No a c heating working 2 small children Moved room supposedly an Upgrade same problem told by the manager it s because the room has a lot of glass Spent the night in a cold bedroom Not enough towels and poor attention to customer needs A very very disappointing stay will be writing to their head office I still had to pay ,0
5657, Rainwater shower head sprayed and leaked over bathroom floor it was swimming in water and had to be mopped up with towel ,0
5658, Although it was the weekend before Christmas it was still a lot of money for the 1 night but my choice and I accept that ,0
5659, The bed just not very comfortable noise in the room at night from pipe work lifts and toilet extract which was off but you could still hear it running somewhere in the building,0
5660, Dreadful wifi connection Don t get a room on the corridor as the lifts are very noisy ask for a corner room,0
5661,No Negative,0
5662, My only downfall is that the rooms that look inside the hotel instead of outside veiw are not the good no natural sunlight cannot feel the morning,0
5663,No Negative,0
5664,No Negative,0
5665, Twin room but beds joined together Moved beds apart but revealed torn carpet and bare concrete Bathroom fittings loose and worn Breakfast expensive at 16 95 per person ,0
5666, The view from our window was over the breakfast restaurant This rendered the room windowless like a prison There was NO milk and insufficient coffee for the morning brew The mini bar was locked we clearly can t be trusted then There were so many lights one of them above the mini bar we simply couldn t find the switch for so we covered it up Breakfast was overpriced I know London is a tourist trap but a fixed cost is stupid why not charge a lower price for coffee and a croissant that is usually all most people want at that time of the morning ,0
5667, Absolutely nothing,0
5668, We have come here previously and everything was so perfect that we even decided to stay an extra night so was slightly disappointed with this experience When checking in the staff seems very stressed and busy which made us feel in the way some of the time after waiting for 5 10 minutes to talk to the receptionist we was told we had to wait until 3pm just to check in so was told to come back later so me and my 6 month pregnant girlfriend had to walk around for an hour then return just to get into the room to relax which was the purpose of the trip When we checked in I was asked if I wanted to swipe my card to be used for room service which I did but was charged 25 just for doing so When I asked about this she said it was for the extras but soon found out nothing was included Also we ordered two pizzas which turned up burnt and in the morning the full English breakfast we paid 24 for didn t even have bacon The shower door let out so much water we had to lay down towls to stop flooding In the room there are huge windows which normally would be lovely to look over London but on this occasion our view was the Waterloo train station so spend most of our trip with curtains closed Finally when we was getting ready to check out at 11 50 we had staff knocking at the door asking how long we could be then at 12 05 we had a very pushy woman asking how long we would be as well and with a pregnant woman it takes a while to do that And when it came to checking out we was waiting around 10 minutes just to do so It s very disappointing because me and my girlfriend was very much looking forward to this little get away and now I feel like iv wasted my money and should of went somewhere else I will consider returning in the future but on my trip to London it definitely won t be at this resort ,0
5669, Attitude of staff The Spa is hurrendows with only 3 lockers unisex changing facilities and sauna steam room only enough for 2 fully grown adults ,0
5670, The room was cold and the A C s heating did not work Breakfast was boring and did not have anything extra only what is necessary You would expect a little more effort from a four star establishment Also breakfast was poorly coordinated and there was always a waiting before seated ,0
5671,No Negative,0
5672, Queuing for breakfast is not what I like Breakfast not ready at 8 15 shouldn t be Scrambled eggs not eatable I prefer a fresh served coffee or espresso ,0
5673, Breakfast could have been a little better quite busy had to queue but they coped well Pillows not quite to my taste but I am very fussy ,0
5674, breakfast area was too small and very cramped had to wait 20 mins to be seated No coffee or tea brought to table No cutlery on table and had to get own ordered special breakfast waited 30 mins and then after chasing we was told not available my wife had to have no breakfast when getting breakfast from area people bumping into you and you have to wait 10 minutes for eggs and ask for bacon and beans to be topped up ,0
5675, My stay there was fabulous and I don t have anything that I don t like ,0
5676, wi fi was rubbish I never got a stable connection at all Dreadful musak played constantly turn it off Room temperature centrally controlled so was constantly freezing It s possibly a London thing but I felt the service charging on every single thing such as the glass of wine i bought in the bar at 8 50 for 175ml became 9 28 even though my red was served in a white wine glass because the bar lady was cross I changed my mind to breakfast and dinner was excessive and frequently not warranted for the service received ,0
5677, There was no parking available at the hotel which isn t a huge deal but having parking is always a bonus The staff was really great and helped us find a good car park about a five minute walk away The view from our room was not great we faced Waterloo Station but I m sure the other side of the hotel could see the London Eye The bar staff and the breakfast staff seemed a little preoccupied and we had some trouble flagging someone down but the drinks were good and pretty reasonable at the bar and the management was usually pretty good at noticing things and trying to adjust ,0
5678, Over 50 people queuing for breakfast anticipated 30 minute wait got a refund Really not acceptable at a modern 4 star hotel Special birthday weekend spoiled ended up having breakfast in Waterloo Station ,0
5679, With only 3 lifts at certain times there is quite a long wait,0
5680,No Negative,0
5681, In my opinion there is no need to pay for breakfast The breakfast area is really small therefore leading to 20 40 min waits to eat We were lucky enough to be guided to a different serving area after waiting 15 min It was not worth the wait However I appreciate the kind gesture made by the staff ,0
5682, Very small bed Check in staff not very friendly Breakfast outrageously expensive Bar crowded and dirty ,0
5683, The first impression on a hotel is everything and the front of house staff are first in line to do this i should know ive worked in a hotel for 6 years now and worked my way up from a receptionist to a manager looking over all departments So as soon as we walk in we immediately get what feels like from all of the concierge porters and door staff that we are not welcome all by what we are wearing i know this because everytime we walked in and out of the hotel we got glares and looked up and down and asked if anybody could help us by just stepping towards the lifts They are the first impression you make on a hotel and they destroyed this for us trust me my money is just as good as the people that are walking around in a tuxedo dont judge a book by a cover it also doesnt hurt to smile Im pretty sure thats what youre paid for Also a massive huge thank you to the gentlemen that told us not to get a taxi to the station and get the metro we had been going one way all weekend to waterloo station but he pointed us in another direction you would trust someone in a hotel to know better than you so we turned left rather than right it wasnt sign posted where we needed to go so we got lost for 15mins We finally got to the station running to catch our train from London Euston time we got there we missed our train by 4mins all thanks to a memeber of staff that cannot give directions correctly dont just point next time explain You cost me 230 to get home i sobbed on the platform station all i wanted to do is get home to my baby so thanks alot you can imagine how angry i was another member of staff not really giving a dam about us I was soo frustrated ive stopped myself writing a review for a few weeks Hope you can take this on board and learn your staff to respect and be helpful to all that stay with you ,0
5684, The temperature of the water in the bathroom was luke warm ,0
5685, I was disappointed with the view all the pictures on the website seemed to show river views We were overlooking a rather busy Waterloo Station ,0
5686, We checked in early at 10 45 ish and was told to return after 2 pm to get our room key we left our bags and returned about 5pm after a busy day and was told they were still working in our room and it would be another 10 minutes We complained as we had to be out at 6 and they gave us another room but we thought this was really poor ,0
5687, I paid the Room Service bill before I actually was given the bill and there was a donation on the bill that would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted to contribute 1 00 I run a cleaning company and overall the place was very clean however was not dusty in the rooms and the mirrors were smeary The taps need descaling but this is me being picky given my profession I know how tight turnaround is There was only one T bag between three people and the room was kitted out for two people even though three were stopping so two glasses two cups two biscuits etc The cleaners were also trying to enter the room at 9 30 and out check out was 12 We inadvertently left our luggage at the wrong Plaza there was no offer to collect which was our mistake but the reception lady said we could ask but the answer would be no Make sure you get the right hotel ,0
5688,No Negative,0
5689, The sofa bed is pretty terrible and I absolutely hate the door to the bathroom It s a sliding glass door which provides very little privacy ,0
5690, I wasn t to please that I was expected to pay an extra 5 to watch a movie,0
5691, The air extractor in the Bathroom ran all night I couldn t sleep past 06 00 The shower fittings fell apart When we reported this at check out we felt no one really cared We too had an overlong wait for breakfast ,0
5692, Staff were disinterested and not helpful except the porters who were most excellent The room was cold and there is nothing in the room to control this Bathrobes were very well worn and tired ,0
5693, N A,0
5694,No Negative,0
5695, the fact our stay was quite expensive compared to similar hotels we have stayed in in London and didn t include breakfast It would have been nice to have been checked in by a smiling receptionist making us as guests to feel welcome and special,0
5696, Bigger breakfast area could be an improvement but a bit of a wait and sitting very close to other tables still didn t take away from the beautiful breakfast Delicious ,0
5697, Optional service charge which Is added automatically on room service as well as a tray charge Double recovery not what I would expect,0
5698, Staff gave directions to Battersea which took us on 2 tubes and a taxi costing us approx 25 and took us an hour making us late When we went to come back we discovered it was a train directly to Waterloo costing 5 and took 15 minutes Not impressed with poor advice ,0
5699, Overall very happy with the Room just the Bathroom fittings were tarnished ,0
5700, I am not sure I got the room i booked as it seemed quite small for a superior double room As it was only a couple of nights however I dealt with it Being woken at 9am on the day of check out while the do not disturb sign was on the door too wasnt great Not usually this disappointed,0
5701, Nothing to improve,0
5702, Inside facing room was a bit claustrophobic as could not open curtains Rubber undersheet on bed took off with difficulty Room not serviced one of the two nights Had to contact housekeeping who put it right ,0
5703, We had to ask for a fourth towel despite there being 4 on the booking Also had to ask for more tea bags and milk in order to make one evening drink and one in the morning ,0
5704, The bathroom was awful there was a shower a bath and a hose and you got absolutely soaked trying to select the right one something needs to be done about that Also the sink tap was loose and rattled around in its socket and the bath when you sat in it was really difficult to get out of as it was lower than the floor level and you needed a step ladder to get out Also the photo bears no resemblance in any way shape or from to the room I was given no superior twin beds just two ordinary single beds with no gap between them at all I wont be going back there anytime soon,0
5705, Having to que for breakfast I have never had to experience this before and won t stay here again for this reason ,0
5706, Understandably the hotel had over 400 rooms that needed cleaning however we were told 5 minutes and the room was much longer than 5 minutes however that being said the room was great and the view was fantastic,0
5707, Went to Marriott County Hall by mistake having known County Hall before it became a hotel Park Plaza County Hall is not at the old County Hall although it is nearby I think it confusing to have a Marriott County Hall and a Park Plaza County Hall close together although a traveller without prior knowledge would probably read the website more carefully than I did ,0
5708, Seems to be good value for money but consider you will have to queue for 20 before to get acc s to the breakfast room never experienced this before Just consider also that you will have to wait circa 7 8 every time you want take the lift Basically overcrowded for the facilities offered Management not present never ,0
5709, I was not very pleased with my stay with park plaza so i took time to respond on this rating i can probably say about 2 3 unlikely to return on this hotel All the while i thought i could experience 5 star experience it was not I was totally disappointed how dirty my room was in fact the cobwebs at the upper lampshade was still there if you look at the left side of the bedroom the carpet was very dirty the room was over decorated at its size very way off on all the 5 star hotels i been through for a 270 a night stay its very unsatisfactory and lastly the buffet was not even close to the top hotels nearby,0
5710, Terrible service when the room filled with water from shower 5 people came after 3 calls not to clean but with us inside the room trying to close even beds with our clothes on them to get access to the floor tubes So 3 of us and 5 of them in a small room without even asking if they can do it just an hour before we check out Getting ready for our bussiness meeting Breakfast small with a tiny cooridords between tables Not worthy ,0
5711,No Negative,0
5712, We had flood every time we showered as shower head too strong for limited space in Bath and ill fitting screen No biscuits or hot chocolate in room and only one flannel left for two of us Also only one chair to sit on and we are two ,0
5713, We had an issue with sofa bed in the room we were in It was broken in the centre prior to our arrival However once we informed the staff we were accommodated in another room fairly swiftly compensated for out trouble,0
5714, The room was dirty dark without view even from the 8th floor The service was slow We asked for an adaptor and we received one two days later Every day during our four night stay we had to queue for breakfast for half an hour The breakfast room was small and we had to wait for the other residents to finish We requested a late check out before arrival as booking com gave us this option We did not receive any reply When we asked at the reception desk we were told that there was no availability unless we paid another 10 pounds per hour It seems that if you pay there is availability if you don t pay the hotel is fully booked ,0
5715, While it was a great idea to have guests decide whether or not to have room cleaned we would have had to give note stating this to reception by 9am I did not even read it until 10AM Why not let it be signed and left in the room or hung outside the door just a thought,0
5716, My only complaints are that the tv in the bedroom area was to the side and it made it hard for us both to see well The sheets seemed too small or were put on wrong and we had to rearrange them And we didn t get enough towels for the whole family We were usually in a hurry to make it to breakfast before the crowd so one child alternated shower days anyway Also extra pillows would have been nice too The kids never complained about the sofa bed ,0
5717, Didn t like the sofa in the lounge didn t like the little tv didn t like scaley kettle for the amount I spent expected a little bit more than a sachet of coffiee,0
5718, Room size is small and dated decor no privacy in the toilet as its separated via a glass door Bed size is small Queuing atleast 20 30 mins for breakfast Not good at all ,0
5719, The rooms are situated near kitchen which is very noisy We had to be asked to move in the middle of night because of this They did move us but the inconvenience of this was very tiring and due to this would not stay again ,0
5720, I paid extra for a city view but your over looking the train station and builders working,0
5721, The room cleaning wasn t as expected Should take care of their staff and follow up on their work ,0
5722, We did not stay long enough,0
5723, When i collected my small lovely coral coloured suitcase from the concierge before leaving it was really grubby and dented ,0
5724, I hated that the bathroom didn t have a real door It was only separated by a sliding partition that didn t offer much privacy The checking in and out process was not smooth Room was not ready when I was told and had to come back a couple of times before it was ready When I checked out I was given somebody else s bill I did not feel that the accommodations equaled the price I was charged ,0
5725, Claustrophobic common areas and mediocre breakfast If you stay here choose a room only rate and go out for all meals there s plenty of choice nearby ,0
5726, Staff are too stressed may be they are under staffed Never seen so furustrated receptionist like this before We waited an exctra time to get the room which was not ready After a long journey we needed to change and kick off for a prebooked activity The delay did not help I did not expect this from such a big and pricy hotel Yet the staff were a smiley as they could be Not entirely bad ,0
5727, Sofa bed very very uncomfortable even for the children to sleep on Requested an extra duvet to put as additional mattress to try and make a little more comfortable ,0
5728, You have to wait a lot of time to have breakfast it seems the area for the breakfast was too small for the capacity of the people they sleep in this hotel There was a lot of dust in the room and especially behind the TV set The bath towels seem to be very old almost becoming gray from white Too expensive,0
5729, Beds could have been more comfy ,0
5730, Sofa bed in family room was a bit lumpy and bumpy ,0
5731, Room was nice and contemporary the bathroom sliding glass door is not practical makes too much noise when opening and closing especially in the middle of the night when others are sleeping AND it is far from sound proof when showering and getting ready while others are still sleeping ,0
5732, The room was too hot despite turning the air con as low as it could go You need persistence to get room service to answer your call ,0
5733, The sofa bed was too squeaky and noisy the other bed was too soft and the rooms were too hot due to not being able open windows ,0
5734, Long queue for breakfast but it was the beginning of the Autumn holiday Breakfast room crowded ,0
5735, Breakfast far too pricey at 19,0
5736, We spent over 10 minutes waiting for an elevator the day we were checking out They definitely need more elevators ,0
5737, everything was perfect,0
5738, Breakfast Had to queue for ages 20 minutes at least to even get a table Queued right along the corridor ,0
5739, Breakfast let it down a bit The food was nice but the organisation of the breakfast service could be inproved ,0
5740,No Negative,0
5741, long queues for breakfast and then another queue to get fruit and toast we had to join the same queue for people wanting cooked breakfast restaurant to small for the amount of guests low water pressure on 13th floor took ages to run a bath and the plug leaked and water was not hot always normally use premier inn and wanted to make this visit special v disappointed,0
5742, The bathroom smelt of damp drains room 413 No signal on EE within my room and wifi kept cutting out on my iphone ,0
5743, Staff lack warmth all very brusque Housekeeping woke us too early with insistent banging on our door repeated 40 minutes later I printed our boarding cards at guest computer in basement keyboard needs replacement characters almost completely faded and illegible,0
5744, temperature control was difficult and bedding was too warm with no alternatives Restaurant was expensive and meals a bit disappointing but plenty of alternatives nearby ,0
5745, The room was quite cold even with AC turned up to max There was no heating as such just a cool breeze coming out of the vents that coupled with mostly tile flooring made it a chilly stay ,0
5746, Room view had windows that don t open as the view is within looking over the restraunts very unusual and no Fresh air,0
5747,No Negative,0
5748, Rooms were a bit small but all we needed we were hardly in them except to sleep ,0
5749, For the money that we paid there was no swimming pool and the beds were really uncomfortable it was like sleeping on a camping bed i found that beds in a premier inn were a lot more comfortable ,0
5750, Room was pokey odd sounds from water heating pipe work that sounded like a dog Room was cold we ended up switching the a c off One pillow each not two and bed wasn t as good as a Premier Inn,0
5751, Service at the restaurant for dinner was slow but it s only a small criticism ,0
5752, The room was small and hot and the a c was noisy and ineffective Little space to relax certainly not possible to enjoy a comfortable breakfast We should have booked the Park Plaza Westminster Bridge which has a better atmosphere,0
5753, Room size for single occupancy was just too tiny I could hardly fit in 2 bags no view atall Tv channels were vintage too with no music channel even a basic movie channel and all was paid ,0
5754, It took ages for us to be able to check out The staff at the checkout desk were oblivious to which customers were next in the queue due to there not being a queue system set up My husband I were waiting patiently for a long time for the 2 or 3 staff members to serve their customers when a rude man another customer went in front of us soon as a staff member was free she didn t say anything like Sorry these customers were in front of you so we had to wait another half an hour It was far too slow ,0
5755, Nothing to complain about,0
5756, The room is kimd of narrow so there is limited space to put 3 luggage in and able to fully open them ,0
5757, It was needed to ask for 2 hours late checkout I was unwell and outside was a heavy rain weather I thought that they will contact with me to confirm or reject my request I spent a lot of money during my stay I was just asking for 2 hours for free The staff did not call me I thought that they are accepting my request In fact they by themselves cut the money and took some extra money as donation from my accounts with unauthorised way which were impolite and very bad behaviours I was perhaps going to cancel my request or extend one night instead of cut more money for just 2 hours It looked like stolen issue therefore I really would like to refund my money The supervisor did not care I confirmed to her that I will complain she was laughing and showed me her name on her T shirt as a kind of the confrontation ,0
5758, Stayed in an accessible family room my husband and I had to sleep on the sofa bed mattress extremely thin and uncomfortable this was really disappointing and effected our impression of the hotel room overall We expected much better quality for the price charged ,0
5759, Immediate payment request for room service Majority of hotels accept signature on delivery receipt ,0
5760,No Negative,0
5761, I have stayed several times at Park Plaza hotels in this exact area their are three within several hundred feet This being my first time at Park Plaza Country Hall I expected the same gold standard that I have experienced at the other hotels I was staying in the Penthouse on the top floor for the weekend which means I expect Penthouse level customer service I had several issues with house cleaning security and most significant of all was the decor in the Penthouse The Penthouse has an amazing view of Big Ben Parliament and London Eye The decor is staggeringly outdated and resembles a 70 s era theme room which is not what I believe they purposely set out to do All of this really soured my experience at a hotel chain that I exclusively choose to utilize when I am in London This experience may deter me from using this specific hotel during any future trips to London That being said I reached out to Hotel Management about my experience and they showed great concern which is in the what did you like section please read ,0
5762, Can t think of anything we didn t like ,0
5763,No Negative,0
5764, Requested a quiet room in advance and this was confirmed at reception unfortunately our room was on a gallery and overlooked the lift area from which banging occurred at night and day but not so noticeable then The noise seemed to be produced by the counter weights on the glass fronted lifts Apart from this very annoying interruption to our sleep everything else was good Have stayed here previously but not in this area of the hotel ,0
5765, Nothing an ideal venue for our visit ,0
5766, There was nothing I could complain about,0
5767, Every time you enter the hotel you have to show your key to make sure you are a resident of the hotel but they need to fix their attitude while asking instead making you feel as you are a intruder want to enter the hotel In addition time of check out they staff didn t help in taking the luggage from the reception to the car they asked me to ask the driver and that it s not their job to do so this single incident made me think twice to come back to this hotel or not Other than that everything was good,0
5768, everything was great we had a fantastic time ,0
5769, Reception was a not efficient I tried to pay for the length of my stay upon checking in but the reception was adamant that I pay the first night I told her that it was better if I do only one transaction on my card but she won t have any of it but after we have done the transaction on the card she asked me if I want to pay the rest of my stay So I thought that was really bizarre She wasn t friendly at all and just get on with what she was doing Came down the following day to pay for the rest of my stay and no greetings only after the transaction she remembered that she ought to ask if my stay was so far any good ,0
5770, Reservation process for family was a mess Moved to a room in front of the elevators Breakfast was always full and had a long waiting queue to get a table ,0
5771, The breakfast was on the expensive side for what you get ,0
5772, Eggs at breakfast tasted like powdered eggs and the mushrooms were tinned ,0
5773, The breakfast could have been priced lower It was a little on the expensive side ,0
5774, The bathroom shower drain produced random flapping noises through the night room 518 The bathroom was grubby around the corners of the shower and floor The air con was noisy and the room was very stuffy with it off Because we paid by debit card the room fridge was locked so any milk we brought to the room could not be kept cold Very limited clothing stowage no draws of any good size the hanging space was limited due to the ironing board spare quilts and pillows OK once they were taken out The safe was just above floor level so on your hands and knees to open it and lock it ,0
5775, 100pounds were charged in case of extras at the moment of checking in and I do not remember having been properly informed ,0
5776, Temperature control in the room was not very good Just a knob with no temperature feedback Hard to get it right as there was quite a delay in the change,0
5777, This hotel does not have parking bay and it makes it difficult to get dropped off or take a taxi We stayed in a family studio and found a sofabed too soft The rooms at Park Plaza Westminster Bridge opposite were more spacious and more comfortable ,0
5778,No Negative,0
5779, There was nothing to dislike ,0
5780, Only down side was our view from the room as we was looking out over the old euro tunnel station But nothing the hotel could do about this and didn t want to move room as our room 504 was really nice ,0
5781, We had to call housekeeping due to stain covered bedsheets for sofa bed which stank took half an hour before anybody came and replaced didn t help put new sheets on Kids were shattered so didn t help matters Staff seemed unhelpful was this due to Not wanting extras ,0
5782, room good have been a bit bigger breakfast room a bit crowded on weekends,0
5783, I had asked at time of booking that the room be feather free especially bedding as feathers trigger my husband s asthma This was not done and so we had to ask again at reception and then wait for someone to swap the bedding Overall staff seemed too busy ,0
5784, N A,0
5785, Bathroom had a smell which we tried to mask with perfume Also didn t like the frosted glass doors on the bathroom ,0
5786, Would have liked breakfast to be included in our room price or at least be a little cheaper ,0
5787, No fresh air No ability to open any kind of window It was very warm on our stay and it felt claustrophobic I appreciate we were on a high floor but maybe a smaller window that would allow some fresh air in would have been good ,0
5788, The cooked breakfast wasn t as good as I expected the eggs didn t taste like eggs and the mushrooms should always be fresh and not tinned The toast machine wasn t working either ,0
5789, As above but rest OK Room small but it is in Central London,0
5790, I never get a respond to my email asking for early check in which they didn t accept at the hotel which ruined my first day in London after such a long flight the WIFI is very bad you barely can browse or send text messages ,0
5791, Elevators were kind of small and slow and for some reason many people were riding them up and back down again for no apparent reason they are glass but the view is only the inside atrium making them crowded ,0
5792, Small room the desk chair did not pull out all the way from under the desk Mattress needed to be replaced I m used to having a flat sheet in between me and the comforter No wash cloths in bathroom ,0
5793, Bathroom let the suite down as it didn t look up to standard compared to the rest of the suite taps and shower looked as if it needed cleaning with a goodlime scale remover ,0
5794, There was nothing i didnt like about the hotel But maybe instead of red wine maybe a bottle of schloer or some other sparkling grape juice But i didnt mind becaus ei know i didnt put that in my notes so staff would not of known but again no complaints i was just as happy with that thought ,0
5795, The bathroom had a seperate door for shower which was not able to close completely and before we realized the entire room was flooded ,0
5796, I prefer to include breakfast in the hotel rate I paid to be more competitive with other hotels in the same class ,0
5797, The rooms were never made up until later afternoon despite us taking off any private signs on the door It was just too late to clean the room And the breakfast room is too small for the size of the hotel We had to wait way too long to get a table ,0
5798, We asked the reception to please pick up the laundry we left in our room and placed inside the bag in the morning before we left the hotel However when we got back later in the evening it was not picked up ,0
5799, Didn t get into room until 3pm and that was only because of me complaining dirty sheets no toilet roll asked for more when came back just thrown in bathroom this is just half of it,0
5800, For the cost the rooms are small compared to North America But bigger here than what you will find at hotels elsewhere Staff were exceptional ,0
5801, Drinks a little expensive but that s London Bar staff lovely though ,0
5802, Breakfast room was quite small and and was some waiting for a table but if gone earlier probably wouldn t have been a problem ,0
5803, our door keys did not work after the first attempt the technician had to come and change the battery which delayed our trip out for nearly half an hour ,0
5804, We were put in a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the train station just near the cleaning room which we heard a slamming door all night We changed room with an upgrade which was still at the back of the hotel and same room Our friend checked in the same night and asked for an upgrade at check in and she got the best view ,0
5805, We shared a room with my brother who was visiting and the hotel provided a pull out sofa bed That was fine Unfortunately the pullout bed was near the window and the regular bed was nearest the door My wife and I slept on the pullout bed just because of the access to windows and natural light I thought that the main bed should be closest to the window instead of the sitting area pullout bed Seemed like a bad layout plan The pullout bed was tolerable but we cannot comment on the main bed because we didn t sleep on it ,0
5806, Was a bit disappointed there wasn t a cafe or bar in the upper area of the hotel for all of the guests to make the most of the view it would have provided as I thought I d read there was But other than that nothing from our point of view ,0
5807, Offering a discount 10 if booking in restaurant then finding out on bill it s only on food and you add 12 5 service charge without asking I always tip myself and hate automatic service charging Breakfast a little chaotic but good value ,0
5808, N a,0
5809, Parts of the breakfast buffet were low quality one room had no natural light which I would expect for a room labeled superior Rooms very small ,0
5810, Paying 167 for 1 night for an extra city view room Which is a view of the Hotel across the road Squashed breakfast tinned food Not enough seats outside to tables Faulty equipment Room not cleaned properly not actually in county hall doors not fitted properly and no milk for a hot drink completely spoilt our 30th wedding anniversary And still no contact apology from anyone at park plaza Appalling standards for an hotel which won an award ,0
5811, no cooking stove ,0
5812, At check in they hadn t realised 2 adults and 2 kids so didn t have sofa bed ready couldn t understand as email clearly stated number of guests Breakfast very busy but manageable ,0
5813, The view over Waterloo Station It is appreciated that this is unavoidable for a number of rooms but actually I might have paid a little more for a room with a better view ,0
5814, Breakfast was disappointing,0
5815, We had a family of 4 with sofa bed and that s the worse bed I have ever slept on There is a huge gap in the thin mattress and I somehow got through the night by putting some towels to fill it up The checkin took a very long time and the room was not ready by the time Since they couldn t predict the time we decided to walk out for site seeing although we were tired after a long flight ,0
5816, Absolutely nothing We will return ,0
5817, The breakfast was not good Taking a run of the mill buffet breakfast and turning in to something special is not complicated and creates a memorable moment that the hotel could be famous for At the moment processed scrabbled eggs cardboard bacon and over baked rolls are not the way forward Unfortunately the pineapple juice had turned and was undrinakable having said all of that the staff were nice ,0
5818, Breakfast was chaotic queues very long waited over half an hour one of the days were we there restaurant area is cramped and people are seated too close to each other so no privacy for a conversation No where to sit in the reception area Not exactly wheelchair accessible Photos are deceptive as the hotel isn t as close to the London Eye as the photos make out ,0
5819, poor breakfast extra charge for the omelet which is unacceptable Big queues very day after 8 30 for breakfast because the restaurant was extra small and you had to wait long for taking the lifts,0
5820, The staff were all friendly However I was shoked the room was so dusty everywhere even the tables and i have kids with me I think they should take care about the cleaning part because it is the most important thing The key card for the room was not working well everytime we had to get in and we had to call the reception for fixing it Also most important channels in the TV Were not working and there is no looby as far as I noticed Also we had a late check in at 3 30pm on the arrival date ,0
5821, Our view was just another hotel across the street Careful when booking the photos seem to give the impression it is the hotel at the end of Westminster bridge but that another from the same company Can sometimes be a 5 10 minute wait for breakfast table as dining area is too small for such a large hotel ,0
5822, The second bed in the suite room was very uncomfortable We had to wait for breakfast every day because the hotel was crowed and the dining room was not big enough,0
5823, Bar prices were a bit costly but had to take this in to consideration as we were in the center of London,0
5824, The bed was too soft for us and nappy changing area not sign posted in the last cubicle in the female WC down stairs also should be in an area where dad can do nappy changes ,0
5825, Room smelled of drains Sofa bed not made up Insufficient number towels toiletries for a family of three No tea coffee etc available in room Breakfast long queue hot food cold No eggs Could not have breakfast in mezzanine designated area insufficient capacity to accomodate volume of guests so served in a conference room not prepared ,0
5826, I chose the hotel as it stated that it has an indoor pool the spa was good but I was expecting a pool ,0
5827, The rooms advertised as having city views were a little misleading as to view any of the city you had to press your head up against the window to look between the 2 buildings opposite although you could then See Big Ben,0
5828, Not a clean hotel or clean room wardrobes and cupboards covered in marks and stains glass in lifts covered in smears dust and stains as were the glass balustrades within the hotel rooms aren t soundproof as room next door had a baby in room which we could hear crying bar and restaurant food not worth the money ,0
5829, Breakfast main lounge was overcrowded at 9 00am so had to use upstairs dining area Then there was a mix up over our pre booked breakfast which had to be sorted However after that all fine ,0

5835, Sofa bed had a metal bar that was very uncomfortable The shower only had hot water no matter how many attempts we made No pool ,0
5836,No Negative,0
5837, I think just a personal thing but I did not like the rooms as they did not have a window to the outside just the interior and thus they were dark The room itself was nicely laid out and the bed was very comfortable ,0
5838, The breakfast wasn t warm enough Tasteless mushrooms and scrambled eggs could be better ,0
5839, I was completely disappointed and mad since the reception staff are generally unfriendly More specifically Brad Brad not only he talks to guests with an attitude and from an upper position he always thinks he is right Without notification to me or alignment with me he deducted the whole amount of the stay from my credit card instead of preauthorization He claimed that this is the hotel policy to deduct the whole amount if the stay is more than 7 nights I told him I was not aware of such policy and asked him to show me where it is written He said it is not written anywhere and the hotel is not supposed to show the guests all the policies I told him I disagree especially if it is related to terms and payments I asked to speak to his manager he said I am the manager Then I asked to speak to his superior Then he said I will cancel the sales and preauthoriz again the amount I told him this will not work as it will take at least 5 days to reverse the payment He said that he is sure it will take few hours Unfortunately he cancelled it and took 5 working days During this period the amount he deducted was stuck between banks and the hotel keeps trying to preauthoriz the amount and notifications from my bank keeps coming to my phone with failed attempted Of course those attempts hurt my credit records with the bank I was devastated and angry but no one said sorry and no compensation were provided to me Horrible customer experience ,0
5840, Had to move room due to an infestation of ants On arriving home and checking the bank we were overcharged by 50 for our stay Hotel also said we used the mini bar when we didnt Not happy ,0
5841, Free Wifi only 1MBit but upgrade to 5MBit just 7GBP per day why so complicated No balcony,0
5842, The open area with the glass just waist high was scary with young kids,0
5843, overall for the cost of the stay I thought the food could have been better only had breakfast and it was not great cleanliness could have been better Location not great ,0
5844,No Negative,0
5845, Stepping out of the bath almost required a ladder ,0
5846, Mold around the bath Inwards window so people from the lifts and on the otherside of the walkway could see straight in your room and there was no daylight in the room No mirror in bedroom,0
5847, Waited past 2 for our room key and little extras tokens for the kids were not received until alot later after I enquired about them this was of course after we had our evening meal small problems no major ones on the whole a pleasurable experience ,0
5848, Long wait for a lift,0
5849, Room over an hour late and staff not my problem attitude,0
5850, Great location Dinner in the restaurant was delicious Housekeeping staff were amazing did a really thorough job Breakfast waiting staff very attentive in difficult and sometimes chaotic working conditions Great views from the room,0
5851, It would have been great if there was a pool or even the option to use the pool in the park plaza just across the road I was disappointed that they no longer have an executive suite it is still mentioned on the website so I had kind of expected it with the room we booked The beds could have been more comfortable but maybe they are just a bit old ,0

6043, Attitude of some of the reception staff particularly at check in Studio was smaller that I expected It came with a kitchenette but it was a squeeze to make a cup of coffee Also fridge space could just about accommodate a 2 litre milk bottle Not enough toiletries provided for a family of four Two tellies provided but acoustics made it impossible to use both at the same time There seemed to be a time lag and echo between the two sets Had to wait ages for sofa bed to be made up on the Friday and Saturday night Not good when trying to maintain a routine for young kids Steam room and sauna area needs to be cleaned more regularly Lots of hair lying about and robes were tiny Also black algae in our shower surround Had to repeatedly get key card reactivated Room was showing signs of wear and tear Faucet tap was loose Mirror was cracked Worst of all was the stench from the drains This was stifling some times usually at night ,0

6052, I stayed in room 621 at checkout reception didn t ask if I had a good stay and I forgot to mention my complaint as I was in a hurry heading off for a meeting room 621 has an adjoining door the noise from the next room into mine was ridiculous the door may as well have been left open I enjoyed multiple different people staying in the room next to me think 622 over course of my stay and was continually awoken at times ranging from midnight to 2 30am in the morning I don t think they realised how think the space was between the adjoining doors this would put me off staying again at this hotel,0

6062, When I arrived there was a red blood looking stain on the bed cover and hairs near the toilet in the bathroom Drinks were very expensive and room maids entered our room in the morning 4 5 times despite us telling them we did not require room maids which i m really not happy about We also started a tab in the bar which we agreed to pay upon checkout on our final day we then had a phone call at 1am whilst we were sleeping to tell us that the bill had to be paid instantly before they shut their tills It s such a shame because the location is excellent ,0
6063, Upgraded to an executive room price was a little high for what you get was told it was a quite room but you could still here guest above us Breakfast was okay but could of been better ,0
6064, I would say that our bathroom could do with being updated as it was noticeably rusty Otherwise it was a great stay ,0
6065, Personally we found the room rather claustrophobic difficult to explain the layout as the outside of the room was actually inside the building so had no view or natural daylight which was quite confusing at 2 45 this morning when I happened to wake Just felt like we state of semi darkness the whole time we spent in the room Fine for one night but had we have had a longer stay I would have to have asked if they had an outward facing room I don t like to sound like a cheapstake but breakfast was 18 each we opted to take a 5 minute walk around the corner and found a small decent caf and had a very adequate breakfast for 5 each,0
6066, A little confusion over the room I booked a superior double and was told that the room was a studio room This just put the booking in doubt Also when we arrived in the room there were balloons and a bottle of wine with a card it was my partners birthday but the card had a different name on not my partner after I queried this the goodies were collected but it left us feeling that we were given the wrong room ,0

6106, Rubbishy A C we stayed in winter and were rather uncomfortably warm I would say that the system could do with an overhaul prior to hotter months Appreciate that lower Windows cannot be opened due to height of hotel and local noise traffic etc however there were no risk upper Windows that might have that facility if a c is an issue,0

7481,No Negative,0
7482, The shower cubicle in the bathroom was very small for this rating of hotel don t drop anything The great water pressure made up for the lack of space in shower though ,0
7483, Tea and coffee facilities should be in the room although you could phone reception and ask for them I feel they should have been there without asking the room could have been bigger,0
7484, Considering the reports and ratings that are celebrating the hotel we were slightly disappointed The furniture of the suite looked a little worn out and old fashioned You can hear the toilet flush from the adjactent floors in the bathroom All in all it doesn t feel very personal and private in the room Breakfast is terribly over priced a usual thing in a lot of hotels to be honest and not worth writing home about Would definetly choose another hotel in London next time ,0
7485, The really noisy flushing toilet which was like you get on an airplane and so loud I was woken by the plumbing in adjoining rooms,0
7486, Although I have commended the breakfast it was possibly a little over the top There really was more food than anyone could sensibly require My niece had to ask for her pillows to be changed as she has an allergy to goose and duck down Replacements were provided immediately and without question but were far too big The staff s anxiety to please is perhaps a little overpowering for people like us who are not wealthy but can manage an occasional special treat ,0
7487, I understand that room rates are high in this part of London and that One Aldwych is a very high standard hotel with 24hr room service but I felt that it wouldn t be too much to ask for tea and coffee making facilities in the room and that breakfast items were very expensive even compared to the restaurant dinner prices However the pub across the road serves an excellent breakfast at less eye watering prices ,0

7496, Room very small wardrobe access in particular small Shower access over the bath not easy for one of us being over 70 years young a room with a walk in shower is quite a bit more expensive The lounge facilities for residents is limited ,0

7501, Incredibly noisy Miniscule bedroom Broken toilet Water issue Plumber finally fixed it at 2am Key for adjoining room opened ours at the same time Guided to sit infront of lift when having a drink in the bar Receptionist in the morning a complete robot Knew we d had a terribly night Instead of starting off with an apology she asked if we d had a good night I commented that there were a few issues to which she replied oh yes I heard For 350 night and 18 glass of fizz I don t expect the adjoining room to open my door have a waterfall in the middle of the night nor do I expect to relax sip champagne in front of a lift shambolic faulty towers ,0

7505, I booked five nights and each night I was charged a different rate I booked my stay through booking com Although the booking site mentioned a daily rate I was very disappointed that at the time of check out the front desk charged me 5 different rates I wonder who s responsible for this lapse Hotel or the booking engine OTA ,0
7506, The walk in shower was pretty tiny ,0
7507, Leaving,0
7508, Breakfast to order not ideal for young children even part buffet would help Film projection in pool great idea but unfortunately you can t really see it ,0
7509, Toilet blocked and drains noisy Would have preferred a walk in shower as rim of bath far too high for short person to step into ,0
7510, The staff were a little over attentive although very polite At lunch I felt uncomfortable as the staff were coming over what seemed like every 15mins ,0
7511, Pillows were terrible a five star hotel should have a selection of pillows to choose from Our hotel room door lock was missing so it didn t feel very secure The bathroom was quite tired and old fashioned plus the pump was noisy Cocktails were expensive and although tasty lacked much alcohol The hotel bar and restaurant were not that of a five star hotel and lacked ambience The pool was average again a little tired and the health club did not feel like that of w five star hotel ,0
7512, We arrived to a king bed when my girlfriend and I specifically wanted and booked twin beds The lag time in getting this handled was a bit annoying because the desk clerk did not take this seriously enough Evidently he does not travel because he was very disrespectful of our request and a bit argumentative Car to airport did not arrive Agostinho was not on duty and we waited at least 20 minutes prior to getting into a cab I personally checked on the car about 10 minutes prior to departing and he had not arrived which I found unusual for Great Britain but then at the specific time and he still was not there I felt that a call should have been made promptly rather than waiting for us to have to ask 10 minutes later Hopefully these comments can be taken in a positive way to help improve customer service for this very nice facility ,0
7513, No wow factor and there was one waiter that did all the things you shouldn t do as a waiter at breakfast leaning across you etc,0
7514, It did take 3 attemps to get firm pillowes for are beds They need to be a bit more clearer some were be it on the web sight or checking Iin about the extra surcharge put on hold on the credit card I did get confused ,0
7515, Room was quite small for a luxury double and the bathroom was quite basic with small single wash basin and basic small glass enclosed shower ,0
7516, The water saving toilet flush is very loud in the middle of the night But better for the environment ,0
7517, Actual bedroom was a little small but to be fair it had all the necessary resources ,0

7524, The Foyer bar was lovely but gets very busy no where else as a guest to go and chill out if full,0
7525, Small grumble We had the afternoon tea However there was a special reception in the lobby bar in connection with the BAFTAs so we had to eat in the general dining area I think we should have been told that when we booked Then we asked if we could chose where we sat and were told no as certain tables were reserved for regular diners No one sat at any of those tables the entire time we were there ,0
7526, My wife had a poor cut of meat when in the restaurant but when we advised the staff the whole issue was handled very well ,0
7527, Nothing 1 Aldwych in my opinion is perfect,0
7528,No Negative,0
7529, From the moment you arrive reception staff are rude unfriendly and in the bar area the staff ignored us for 30 mins then when we sat at a empty reserved table as we only wanted one drink before we went to dinner we were kicked off the table in an abrupt manner we went to the bar area couldn t get served left after 20 mins table still sitting empty Will never return,0

7753,No Negative,0
7754, The place could do with a revamp but they don t need to try harder because they have the traffic anyway,0
7755, The room was small the elevator was quaintly small and the staff s directions were correct but not always easy to follow For example they would say turn right then go until the street ended then turn right and what you wanted was right there But they wouldn t know the names of the street or tell you that right there meant cross a major street and go 1 or 2 blocks ,0
7756, Nothing ,0

7760,No Negative,0
7761, Elevator could be bigger but that s only because the age of the building We managed ok ,0
7762, The housekeeping was a little flaky Face towel disappeared and never returned Milk wasn t topped up Room was small but Parisian hotels usually are Double glazing would be good despite being on 7th floor there was noticeable street noise We had a really good deal on the price I do not know if I would have been so happy paying full price ,0
7763, I really don t understand how this hotel has a four star rating My room was very small super dark and it wasn t the cleanest hotel room I saw No drinking water in the room or fridge Staff is not at all friendly or hospitable they asked me to pay the day BEFORE my check out like I was a thief or something similar and I felt very uncomfortable about this I travel for work every week and I have visited hundreds of hotels and honestly this was the first time I felt this way The location is excellent but it is possible to find much better options at the same cost or even cheaper ,0
7764, Shower enclosure in bathroom did not prevent the bathroom from flooding each time I took a shower ,0
7765, Limited interaction with hotel staff more to do with the position and height of the reception desk relative to the exit ,0
7766, Breakfast costs 16 euros but is quite limited no fruits and vegetables are not fresh but most people go for breakfast at nearby cafes anyway ,0
7767, Room is cleaned a bit late in the day after lunch ,0
7768, All great for me thanks ,0
7769, No shower door so the bathroom got very wet after showers,0
7770, We had requested a quiet room The room we had 404 was connected to an adjoining room through locked double doors It meant we could sometimes hear the conversations of its occupants Luckily they were not too noisy people It should not have been allocated to us If they are going to use two rooms for separate parties then they should brick up and soundproof the connecting space ,0
7771, Room is small but is normal in Paris Facility is a little bit old but kept clean and everything works ,0
7772, We were told we got upgraded on arrival to the Eiffel tower view room wow great In we go into the smallest elevator ever 2people max to the top floor The room was tiny but yes the balcony did have a view of the Eiffel tower for what that was worth What they failed to tell us also was that one of the shower panels was completely missing I mean if we turned on the shower the water had nowhere else to go but all over the bathroom floor Crazy We informed reception and were given a different room which turned out to be twice the size of our upgraded room and we could still see the Eiffel tower from the balcony So much for upgrades,0
7773, Lacking on the fine details some TLC will help but it doesn t bother or hinder the experience at all one just notice those things ,0
7774, The wifi was quite slow at times It seems to be unusable depending on the time of day when hotel guests were around ,0
7775, Size of the double bedroom makes it not too roomy for 2 people The 2 beds were basically set as one king size bed which is not good if you don t want to sleep next to the other person ,0
7776, Some Staff could be more friendly and a proper lounge with a bar to relax in would have been nice Bathroom was very jaded and shower over bath had a slippery surface ,0
7777, In the closet was dust I had to clean hangers at first and then put my things,0
7778, A lovely well placed hotel I was however only able to afford it when on offer ,0
7779, I think the price for Breakfast at 16 euros per day is too expensive but you wont find anything cheaper nearby ,0
7780, In both the rooms we have stayed in it was difficult to take a shower without flooding the entire bathroom ,0
7781,No Negative,0
7782, Staff rude I had pre paid before we had arrived When we got to the hotel because we didn t have the credit card used we had to pay cash on arrival there was no need for this as the room was already payed for so we had to pay twice Hotel is quite old fashioned not up to 4star standards rooms are very small also bathroom Wouldn t return again ,0
7783, Could only have the Continental Breakfast in your room Dont understand why Room was pretty compact though comfortable not sure where i would have put the breakfast see above,0
7784, Room claustrophically small Very dark decor Even with all the room lights on it was very difficult to see what you were reading or look at a map Lighting better in bathroom which was were we planned the day out If you put your suitcase at bottom of bed there was no floor walking space Handles on chest of drawers came off everytime you opened one Safe wouldn t program right so didn t use it Skimpy small hard towels in bathroom Hotel further out than it appeared on maps to main tourist attractions On line photos made hotel look modern luxurious and large It s a very small lobby and maximum 2 suitcases and 2 people in elevator Hated stepping off elevator into darkened hallway This was due to economy lighting and dark wood and dark colours on walls A few steps brought the hallway lights on and in general place was quaint couldn t imagine coping with kids in such small twin room We d requested separate twin beds but basically got a divided bed with one headboard We made do but was not ideal for two separate adults to use Was ok for purpose used but not one I would recommend to others ,0
7785, The Bathroom could be better designed ,0
7786, Only thing I can complain about was that the batteries were dead in the Remote ,0
7787, Room Service was overly expensive More than nice fine dining and when we tried to book airport shuttle times were not convenient ,0
7788,No Negative,0
7789, The ceiling in the room was leaking water in two spots in the toilet and beside the air conditioning The cleaning service threw away a hair conditioning of ours and the hotel did not have one to replace it Also there were many bags of garbage from the cleaning service blocking the lift s door and in the middle of the corridor Not very pleasant at all In the Eve s overnight the card did not open the reception door and we got stuck outside the hotel for 10 minutes at a negative temperature until someone opened the door ,0
7790, Very very small rooms Central heating had air in it and clicked all night What anoyed me was at check out I told the staff and in typical French maner the girl could not care less Not even a cursory sorry Nothing Strange for a US owned business ,0
7791, Breakfast staff considering the rates for breakfast did not do enough e g direct customers to the coffee machine and milk ,0
7792, Room is a little bit too small ,0
7793, On the first day we arrived internet was really good but for the other days I cannot say that it was fast Also hair dryer isnt good if you have thin hair that dries slowly as mine you have to bring your own ,0

7799,No Negative,0
7800, The shower should have had a bigger glass partition to keep water from getting on the floor We had trouble getting clean face cloths every day ,0
7801, The bathroom was outdated and dirty with mouldy tiles dirt around the toilet parts and peeling and cracked paint bodged tiles The bedroom was lovely but extremely dusty I had to use wet wipes to dust the bed head etc as I have a dust allergy and was kept awake the first night coughing In the day light I realised why ,0
7802, Room very small dark and rather claustrophobic Bed at an angle to fit it in the tiny room Bed pretty small too Room was hot and although window opened it faced on to back of building with all the noisy air conditioning and heating boilers ,0
7803, Room was a little small but that wasn t really a problem you trade that for the great location anyday ,0
7804, I wanted to give another guarantee card than the one I had prepaid with and the guy at the desk was new and demanded that I repay my booking with the new card Which I did and they reimbursed me on the initial card but I suffered a foreign exchange supplementary cost of 15 ,0
7805, Small rooms Smelly corridors No soundproof Fake pictures on the offer There are superior classic rooms and superior delux classic are actually former rooms of the servants with separate staircase etc etc,0
7806, The lift I don t think I d want more than two people at a time or one plus one case Personally I wasn t prepared to chance it so I walked up and down the four flights of stairs Every time Bed not very comfy Ordering room service time consuming and only after doing so and having to wait 45minutes for order did we realise it was outsourced and not done by hotel ,0
7807,No Negative,0
7808, Rooms are very outdated old furniture nasty bathrooms which need a complete overhaul lighting extremely poor Rooms small by U S standards Hotel rating too high for such poor quality and facilities ,0
7809, Air conditioning was quite poor at 25 degrees it was way too cold We preferred to open the window but it s not always an option dust noise Lightning might be better bed lights high above the bed and no ceiling lamp and lightning above the mirrow in the bathroom for doing make up ,0

7821, No free parking as stated when booked only a public car park which cost us 64 for 2 days Breakfast was not included in the price even though it was suggested this was the case at check in 32 for 2 people a day is an absolute rip off ,0
7822, Narrow hallways and staircases tiny elevator and you still have to go up and down a half flight of stairs This was okay for us but those with mobility issues or a lot of heavy luggage might have problems ,0
7823, Tables were not cleaned up and the buffet was not replenished Staff totally indifferent Had to ask several times for items like bread yogurts Very small elevator hardly enough for two Certainly not enough room for a suitcase ,0
7824, I was really unhappy when there where no tables ready for breakfast Staff was hiding in a kitchen and did not clean tables and did not prepare tables for new guests I start to prepare table myself as there were nobody to ask for help Lady in charge appears in fey minutes and start to follow her duties Next time I will avoid to have breakfast in this hotel ,0
7825, Some minor things beds a little hard a bar fridge in room would have been good carpet in need of some repair in entry to room ,0
7826, Very thin wall If someone who cannot pay attention to the neighborhood unfortunately stays in the next to your room that s too bad I tried to be patient but I finally knocked the wall at 2 AM in the midnight in order to stop happy laughing British English conversation I could not use the air conditioner because I found a lot of black mold in it then I did not feel good ,0
7827, Very small lift The room was small for 3 people but adequate via European standards ,0
7828, I had a room on the top floor which actually gave me a rooftop view of Paris Unfortunately it was like being in an attic the sloped roof took up half of the small room It was difficult to navigate around the very hard bed to get to the wardrobe and I had to stand on a chair to use the safe It was also extremely hot even with the air conditioner running all of the time The windows did open but with no screens there were issues with mosquitos and birds flying in I didn t change my room because I didn t spend much time in it ,0

7966, Well Although I liked my breakfast it was not included in the room charge ,0
7967, Avoid the dingy standard rooms facing the courtyard Soviet style views dated and worn furnishings and subpar luxury ,0
7968, The Intercontinental breakfast was kind of limited in terms of options especially for the price charged In the room the espresso machine didn t work or I couldn t find out how ,0
7969, I have stayed here occasionally over 5 years The breakfast which used to be quite special has now become appalling The cups and saucers have gone to be replaced by the standard holiday inn mugs The magnificent buffet has gone and replaced with meagre pre laid fruit dishes and not a lot of choice of any thing else There used to be an omelette area that s gone too For warm food you have to choose off Theo Randall s Italian breakfast menu at mouth watering prices If the food we had was a reflection don t even bother The fried rosti tasted like a brick Service too was underwhelming forgotten orders wrong orders etc and the experience all in all very poor If this is IHG s flagship hotel in London then unfortunately the 5 star experience they want you to have in the rest of the hotel is not matched by the breakfast I guess it has been done to make more money with fewer costs Go across to the Serpentine caf for a better breakfast Also there are also currently no toilets on the ground floor except those at the back of the restaurant above which involve a flight of stairs for both gents and ladies So beware if you are not so mobile We will pack our bags and move on to other accommodation next time in London in the future ,0
7970, Breakfast buffet has poor selection of foods and I had to pay 27 for the toast and butter I had Breakfast wasn t included in the booking,0
7971, Not enough coffee in our room only 3 packets so one of us couldn t have a second cup The coffee supplied at Breakfast the following morning was COLD and had no taste of coffee whatsoever ,0
7972, I asked for a quite room but since the room I booked was of a standard higher than regular I was given a bigger but louder room facing busy street I had to change at 1 am in the morning ,0
7973,No Negative,0
7974, The room s view location The staff should informed me during the checking in that the room will view to the intrnal yard Which I may ask them for upgrade,0
7975,No Negative,0
7976, The bathroom requires minor maintenance repairs attention to the sink plug hole to keep water in and the hand shower in the bath needs attention due to a heavy leak when in use ,0
7977, My over all experience was just a disappointment the room quality was less than satisfactory because the view was horrid and it was poorly lit the food was below average it took an hour and twenty minutes to bring up a pair of scissors the hotel was grossly over priced for nothing other than the name it carries extremely disappointed with my stay ,0
7978, I was promised another room with a better view but when I checked later there was nothing in the system about it BUT when Karem the night manager heard about it he immediately contacted me and came him self to my room to make it right,0
7979, 1 Bed quality is poor King size bed is simply 2 singles joined Pillow choice and mattress is poor 2 No free wifi 3 Room size not great for price,0
7980, They didnt clean my room for 2 days even though i called them to confirm about cleaning and tidying the room Also i didnt have the Clean My room door hanger nor the don t disturb one ,0
7981, I was disappointed with the Spa you could only use it if you paid for a treatment We only wanted to go in for half an hour to freshen up but were unable to do so ,0
7982, They didn t clean the room one day Had to call 4 times for someone to bring shampoo Ordered Croissants to my room at 7 00 am and they were dry ,0
7983, This hotel needs to match the breakfast to the quality of the hotel ,0
7984, Our iron in the room didn t work Not a big deal but I would have like to run it over my dress before dinner ,0
7985,No Negative,0
7986, I asked for early check in but the room was not ready and we had to wait a while ,0
7987, The room was below expectations Although we had a superior king room which should normally have a view it overlooked the back street When we asked the staff to give us a new room the response was that the hotel was too full Having booked a month earlier i dont believe they didnt give us a view room either bc of our late arrival or bc we booked through booking com For this price there are many other hotels which can provide better accomadations within the vicinity It was a definete disappointment on our part My advice is either pay a bit more and prefer 4 seasons or pay a bit less and stay at the hilton They re all 100meters away from each other Having stayed in all of those this was the worst vfm ,0
7988, Nothing perfect stay ,0
7989, My biggest issue with the hotel were the other guests Rarely have I spent so much time around so many affected rude and ignorant individuals Yes the hotel costs a few quid yes you need a bit of money to stay there but quite why people feel that makes them better then the staff working there is beyond me The rudeness and arrogance of my fellow guests was almost enough to ruin my stay ,0
7990, Breakfast a little frantic restocking of bowls for fresh fruit and even butter at the breads table,0
7991, Nothing none,0
7992, The rooms soundproofing is not very good because sometimes I hear sounds coming from the rooms while I am walking to my room ,0
7993, Very small amount of milk in room we had to ask for coffee pods too ,0
7994, The room was too small and messy there was no cabinets to put our staff in except one tiny one and the rest were without keys to be able to open it The toilet was too small and there was a blockage in the bacenet and the water was not going down We ordered club sandwich the presentation of the sandwich was very bad as if I ordered it from a grocery and not from a famous hotel like intercontinental The taste was disgusting I swear I wanted to vomit after I ate the first bite Our stay in that hotel was like a night mare and instead of the staff helping us after all what we faced after a long journey they charged us for 591 instead of 561 for that night ,0
7995, Air conditioning a bit noisy ,0
7996,No Negative,0
7997, It was perfect for us on a one night stay,0
7998, Could have been more than 2 Nespresso pods if you are a couple it would be great to maybe have 2 decaf 4 regular pods but then again not many hotels have a Nespresso machine in the room to begin with ,0
7999, Bus stop is at 2 minutes walk to Hilton H No supermarkets nearby ,0
8000, Room was too hot both windows open heating low as we could get it so hot my partners asthma was set off and he was up all night as he couldn t lie down had to have water from minibar to cool himself The receptionist let us have the water and advised us that next time to call reception to help,0
8001, Our room was very warm even with A C and didnt have the best view The Mini Bar in the fridge was VERY expensive 3 50 for a KitKat and 5 for a 500ml bottle of water though I guess that the majority of Patrons wouldnt have to worry about the cost of water The Buffet style Breakfast was also a bit of a farce no information given as to whether we helped ourselves gave an order etc and there were lots of children running around Also some of the staff need to be more aware of their non verbal communication ,0
8002, 10 for two small bottles of water was a bit steep given everything else is excellent value Could hear the guest next door easily at night ,0
8003, towels smells not nice receptionist not fully respect the ambassador golden card I was carried by designating low quality room ,0
8004, Room was small for the price and not well fitted i e no hooks to hang things up A free bottle of water would have been a nice addition,0
8005, Wifi is not free The wifi cost could have been included in the room price Unfortunately I couldn t to get access to the wifi It didn t work smoothly ,0
8006,No Negative,0
8007, Room and in particular the bathroom is a tight squeeze for 2 people and from this perspective I don t think the hotel offers good value for money We also experienced extremely poor service at the Arches Bar which given that we were out celebrating a special occasion affected our evening and would be enough to say we wont be returning ,0
8008, Breakfast service and food quality not the best for this kind of hotel Personal note poor phone reception 5 for small bottle of evian ,0
8009, Service Very slow We were at Gin and Jazz and one of the young male waiters just shrugged when we chased the already late wine Earlier in the day we ordered 2 glasses of champagne in the bar and it took ages to arrive We ordered 2 glasses of champagne in our room which took 30 mins to arrive ,0
8010, This time I had a number of issues during my stay namely There were no slippers or bathrobe in the room There was no complimentary water the mini bar was absolutely empty All my cosmetics testers as I came for 2 days only were thrown away by the housekeeping,0
8011, Staff is not as expected from such a great name of a hotel Lack of experience lack of knowledge and I strongly believe they need so much in training ,0
8012, The rate is over priced The breakfast end at 10 00AM would be better if its 11 00AM,0
8013, overcharged by hotel on room and i ended up paying for someone else room service hotel did not care and continued to charge my card ,0
8014, Poor service 3 days asking for something tell they send me Corridors are really dirty and we adked for cleaning but they didn t In the breakfast area the treatment is really auful they way they check your room number is like a school manager Wated so long to check in plus they refused to give us even 1hour for checkout althoug I explaned that I have doctor appointment and its hard to make it on 12pm but they didnt care Room service is the worst ,0

8121, As I said the coffee maker didn t work Apart from that I loved it ,0
8122, Oh hotel is quite nice but sorry to say the location is terrible not acceptable Hotel should have a shuttle for guests to take them to the closest metro station to avoid walking through the intimidating neighbourhood especially with kids ,0
8123, Location was far from airport and Trocadero where I wanted to mainly visit Also the breakfast was rubbish Hardly any variety ,0
8124, Hardly any tea coffee in the room and a charge at reception for more for the coffee machine The restaurant attached was very expensive and at night there isn t anywhere nearby to eat you need to take the metro to another area ,0
8125, There are a lot of migrants around the hotel sleeping in tents Because of the location you can t avoid to walk across these tents which is very scary together with your family One night we made a group of 4 adults at the nearest metro station to get to the hotel safely It is very crazy and it will be worse and worse ,0
8126, Location is the downside there are a lot of refugees outside HOWEVER it is not as severe as any of the reviews I have seen previously Yes there are quite a lot and I can see how some may be slightly intimidated There are only quite a lot on the walk to the metro but we were never hassled nor stared at or made to feel uncomfortable Police presence further up away from the hotel where the refugees are ,0
8127, I didn t like the fact that it s located close to the refugee asylum seeker camp,0
8128, Saw a mouse small rat in or room on the last morning Terrible views from the room Unless you are a keen motorway and flyover spotter ,0
8129, Horrible location loud discotheque right under the hotel not so great breakfast on paper plates and cups the breakfast area is in the reception no soaps in the rooms the separate toilet room is very small Overall not worth the price at all ,0
8130, The location We stayed there so our son could walk to an event at salle Pullman les docks ,0
8131, The location was terrible I expected more from the Novotel brand I was very disappointed We booked and paid for 3 nights and left after one I have never felt so unsafe in my life ,0
8132, Staffs ,0
8133, staff not friendly enough tea bag sugar coffee etc only one provided in the room we are two no milk at all no regular tea bag only herbal tea there is no universal wall socket to charge phone or laptop all mainland european standard hotels must be universal they forced me to buy a converter for a one night use there are plenty of things to improve standard ,0
8134, Location is in a very economically depressed area There were over 30 homeless people sleeping near the sidewalk on the walk from the metro The rooms have paper thin walls I not only heard my neighbors conversations but also had a nightclub blaring music until 0200 in the morning It was so bad I could hear the words to the songs with my windows closed ,0
8135, Location of this hotel is very bad its not safe to travel in night time with kids in this area but metro is really close in 5 minute walk We use metro for all our visits ,0
8136, outside the hotel in neighbourhood there was too much mess poor housekeeping There were dozens of immigrants camps arround the hotel which is the main cause of mess in the surrounding area ,0
8137, The location of this hotel is horrible When we took the bus to the station it kept going to a bad neighborhood This hotel is located near a bridge where it is full of refugees and homeless people around When we got off the train people kept staring at us and smelled like someone peed the whole time when we walked to the hotel from the station We felt very insecure Staffs were okay but I feel that they can be more helpful to those who are traveling Few of them were just lazy with their answers Also They don t really smile ,0
8138, The walk from the Metro to the hotel is fairly intimidating due to all the tents and refugees homeless people but everyone left us alone However would not recommend for single females especially at night ,0
8139, The area around the hotel was covered with refugees and homeless While we felt sorry for their situation we didn t feel safe The hotel explained that they wouldn t be harmful to us but taxi drivers police and others around warned us to not walk around with the kids especially with luggage etc We did see a lot of cop activity and fights one evening upon returning to the hotel So this limited our ability to make the most use of the metro there We opted to taxi in most of the time ,0
8140, Location has lots and lots of homeless people mostly from outside Europe Furthermore there is so much garbage lying around It is the worst neighbourhood I have seen in Paris One does not walk outside feeling safe Staff was friendly but some did not dress like a hotel employee but like tourists Breakfast was not well organized Dirty floor location of food not logical Mediocre food PAPER PLATES ,0
8141, There are a lot of homeless people living under overhead bridges across from the hospital We mainly used uber to travel to places ,0
8142, Location as such doesn t look safe specially at night Lot of people homeless near by not judging ,0
8143, Where do i start 1 Horrible location Even though it was walking distance from nearest metro Porte de la chappelle it was a nightmare walking towards hotel as it was flooded with immigrants who have taken over the pavements trash everywhere my family was really scared at times 2 Its not a cheap hotel during hot hot summer i expected proper working air cons We reached hotel about 6pm we went to bed early about 7 30 to be ready for next morning but could not sleep until midnight as it ir con was pathetic We spoke to reception but they knew it and just said they can t do anything 3 Entrance Thought it would be a decent entrance as i have seen in many hotels of same branch but it was just very average and dull and ofcourse with barely working air con ,0
8144, Where should I start This hotel is rated a 4 star although it was a clean facility with good amenities the location was a nightmare for anyone especially families The metro station is nearby but you have to walk through a very very dirty and shady area It looks like a war zone The area was full of homeless refugees that are living under a bridge across the hotel It is not safe to walk from the metro to the hotel You have to take taxi to ensure your safety I do not recommend this hotel until this area is cleaned up and refugees are no longer misplaced I asked for a refund and management refused This hotel location put a damper our tourist experience in Paris,0
8145, the hotel should have highlight more clearly the location of the hotel it is near the overhead bridge where the refugees camp is lotsa of refugees camping under the bridge however sercurity was okay as every nights when we returned late to the hotel we saw police petrol at the area basically the refugees do not disturb the area smell bad though ,0
8146, Too noisy in the street by night Nightclub or pub too close so could hear music until 3 am Room too hot Area and pavements around the hotel full of homeless people very dirty streets just opposite the hotel Would not recommend this hotel if you travel alone by public transport as you won t feel safe to walk from tube station to the hotel unpleasant 10 min walk ,0
8147, Bathrooms are flooding when showering design fault Still they are clean and large Breakfast lacks vegetables ,0
8148, Terrible parking They let more cars in than there are places available which causes chaos and high risk of having car scratched Location of the hotel is also terrible hundreds of homeless people sleeping just outside so going for a walk is not a good idea I do not recommend this hotel to anyone especially for families ,0
8149, The location of the hotel isn t the best,0
8150, There were no travel cots available so baby slept on single bed mattress on the floor Nearby shops metro station were convenient though tent camp nearby was off putting to start with If you re paying on card with a foreign currency ask for a full receipt at checkout We re still waiting for one 3 weeks later and not sure if we ve been overcharged for something or if the exchange rate was not great ,0
8151, Hotel is located in very rough area of the Paris due to that We had to order unhealthy take aways Unable to explore and experience local area Travel via Uber expensive compare to the trains hotel does not have a restaurant so only choice you have is to order take away or take uber to some nice area to dine toilet is as small as the size of the plane toilet ,0
8152,No Negative,0
8153, the breakfast is very basic and the area around the hotel is scary and dirty I was travelling with wife and 2 kids I was looking around us every second to make sure no one was following us The reception area is the same area as the breakfast which is something I have never seen before,0
8154, location was terrible it is across the road from a city of tents of homeless people the room was like a sauna when asked if the air con was broken we were told the only use air con in summer the staff were the opposite of a rae of sunshine Especially one lady that was incapable of smiling I felt very unsafe here and chose to take taxis into Paris and to train stations instead of walking with my family even the taxi drivers would say oh that part of Paris is not very good ,0
8155, Location was poor in a rough area with a sote for homeless people opposite Breakfast selection was poor Same selection every day Staff were not very receptive Room wasn t service properly at times and when missing items were requested they would not deliver them to the room you would have to go down and get them ,0
8156, Firstly it s located in a bad place Just adjacent to the hotel are makeshift tents most probably of migrant population It feels dangerous to go alone in the streets Facilities were ok As it was located in bad part of city you want to rely on hotels restaurant But this hotel doesn t have an operational restaurant They claim to provide free wifi but for my entire stay there was no wifi Rooms weren t cleaned properly Someone s inner were lying inside my room Toilet is located outside the bathroom and is one of the size to be found in aeroplane ,0
8157, Location was terrible the area was unclean and smelled terrible And in front of the hotel there was a site area for homeless people This made the area very unsafe to walk through especially at night Breakfast was basic to say the least not many options hardly any vege options Hotel staff were not very accommodating to any requests and when something was missing in the room due to poor room service i e No tea bags or no milk or no cups no soap the hotel expected you to come to reception to collect the missing items rather than bring them to the room ,0
8158, the room was so hot I could not sleep overnight also the wifi was so weak I use my data the location was quite unsafe ,0
8159, Room appears clean but smelly Bad odour in corridors as well Breakfast was just as bad as not much to choose from Parking was expensive and difficult to get in and out The area where the hotel was situated seems dodgy Could not wait to get out of that place ,0
8160, Location is really rough and nothing really around We took uber everywhere to avoid walking around the area as it was really off putting had a lot of beggars Really nice hotel don t know why they would put it in that location,0
8161, The second bed was a bit decieving from the listing We thought we were getting a 2 bedroom suite when in fact the bedrooms are just separated by a curtain ,0
8162, causing a lot of inconvenience to us and my friend Again requested next day but invain had to come back spoiling our trip due to hotel zero cooperation no refund terrible ,0
8163, The location makes you feel unsecure There were a lot of homeless or refugees making homes in tents along the only route from the subway station to the hotel The hotel is also near to the central waste collection center which you must pass by onroute to the subway ,0
8164, The location and neighborhood is less to be desired Graffiti everywhere dirty strong smell of urine reffugee camp under flyover Please look after your belongings when approached by beggers When traveling at night use VTCs type very reasonable price,0
8165, Two of my friends had money stolen from our safe and staff showed no interest in helping us one lady on reception actually laughed and seemed to think we were making it up Surrounding area didn t feel entirely comfortable or safe as there is a big group of homeless people Area not well lit and we struggled to figure out how to walk there from the tube station although in daylight this wasn t a problem but there is a very busy road to cross with no traffic lights in parts,0
8166, Area in which hotel is located is not the best one ,0
8167, nothing,0
8168, The carpet had holes all throughout it where people had dropped cigerrettes on the floor It wasnt very pleasant to walk over Also asked restaurant staff if they could blend a banana and milk for my son and we was told nope No explanation why ,0
8169, Location though not the best is alright and not at all as bad as some visitors find it ,0
8170, We have 3 persons when I booking on this website they described this suite have two bedrooms but in fact only use transparent curtain to separate bed and lounge where put small sofa bed it is totally wrong info from booking com so we have to take one more suite when we checking in the outside of the hotel is terrible dirty and not safe feeling but near to airport and exhibition it is good for me ,0
8171, Restock tea and coffee facilities have proper cups for tea and coffee not paper cups have a separate desk for reception separate to shop and bar as there was always people at the desk buying things and not enough staff to attend to customers staff not very friendly no greetings unless you greet them first ironing facility only on one level should be available in every room Our pre arranged transport waited for us outside and we waited inside despite front desk knowing that there was transport waiting for for customers and us telling them we were waiting for transport to pick us up we had to go outside and asked the driver who had been waiting for us for a while when we noticed he was there Very poor service ,0
8172, The area where hotel is situated looked a bit out of city it is near near motorways and recycling facility But then everything else about the hotel covered up for this tiny little shortfall ,0
8173, The location was terrible it was too far away from the sights area is run down Hotel wasn t easy to find even with sat nav and parking proved difficult to get in and out Breakfast in the hotel was poor quality runny snotty eggs were the only cooked item The same food was brought out that had been out the day before The same Stale quiche had been put out all three mornings I was there ,0
8174, The price is more relative to the location than the hotel Although the location is ok in relation to getting places in the city relatively quickly we didn t feel the most comfortable walking between the metro station and the hotel as the surrounding area were very run down and did not feel particularly safe at times A small problem was also the fact that we chose a non smoking room on arrival but were given a smoking room This didn t turn out to be that much of a problem though as it did not smell or effect our effect the hotel really but it may not be the best for others ,0
8175, As a woman travelling on my own I thought the walk the metro wasn t pleasant I was also disappointed that the English language TV service in the room did not work as advertised ,0
8176, The staff were super rude and not helpful at all Half of the things in the room didn t work airconditioner fridge microwave When we asked the staff to get them fixed they were pretty nonchalant about it and didn t really sound that interested in it Eventually ofcourse nothing got fixed Also please note that you ll be staying at the very edge of Paris in an area full of Drug Addicts and some other unpleasant creatures Better get a room in the centre if you can afford it ,0
8177, If you need to take the elevators you just need to wait for the cleaners they keep it busy doesn t matter if you are in rush,0
8178, very bad location in a really insecure and unsafe neighborhood NEVER even try to book there there were people using DRUGS just outside the hotel we tried to cancel our booking when we saw the hotel but they d dn t let us The staff was not helpful and grumpy On top of this the TV was broken and there were peanuts behind it they probably d dn t clean t properly also there was a constant smell n the elevators Later on we moved to a different place we were told that the hotel was located in the sketch est neighborhood of Paris right next to the dumping ground A BIG NO if you want to stay SAFE ,0
8179, Slightly small reception Basic breakfast parking not free although you pay a special rate of 18 euro all day ,0
8180, Air con didn t work properly They threw away my water bottle which was on the desk ,0
8181, Parking is super expensive Hotel staff really dishonest We had several times random expenses always ask for the detail of your bill ,0
8182, I booked for 3 guest but only supplied a bottle of water and tea for 1 person When explaining this to the staff the manager was extremely rude and disrespectful immediately She would benefit from doing a customer service course as the treatment my friends and I received was one of the worst I have ever experienced I would never stay here again and I would not advise anyone else to stay here ,0
8183, A lot of reviews talk about feeling threatened or intimidated by the area certainly if 10 year old girls and old women begging scares you avoid St Denis is not the nicest of places but convenient for what I needed Avoid the scrambled egg truly awful but good selection otherwise for breakfast I and others took food away for later and no comment was made by staff Take coffee with you not a lot by the kettle ,0
8184, The toilet extractor did not work and the toilet had a bad smell There is no aircon Lucky for us it was cool weather but I can imagine in hot months it can get very uncomfortable The area is not safe We walked to the metro station and nearly got attacked by a very aggressive black man that approached us in a very suspicious and aggressive manner and swore at us We just kept walking faster and went into the metro station It was very scary as we had our 10 month old baby with us We are so grateful the man did not hurt us ,0
8185, Paying extra for parking The room was so warm we had to keep a window open so was noisy at night as it s located so close to a lot of roads Lots of people begging and living rough outside,0
8186, The surrounding area was at first sight alarming with rubbish strewn all around There also appeared to be a number of refugees and vagrants begging in the area which again at first was a little daunting ,0
8187, I could not fault anything ,0
8188, the manager of hotel wants to pay all the money there but in greece there is not the opportinity to take more than 480 euros per week and she didnt accept the card which we have already sent in order to pay the rooms ,0
8189, The location was not the best close to a metro line but a bit of a strange area,0
8190, The nearby garbage collection facility was not somewhere I want to see in Paris Although I did not experience any bad situation the neigborhood does not look secure ,0
8191, Is the worst possible location The hotel is in a run down area right next to a homeless shelter Not great at all when your girlfriend is frightened to walk from the hotel to the tube station ,0
8192,No Negative,0
8193, The location is fine if you re driving or getting a cab or Uber but as a pedestrian it s a nightmare if you don t know that area There is a metro station nearby but it is really hard to reach it you need to do a huge detour to be able to cross the high traffic streets around the hotel Or maybe there s a secret passage that I missed who knows In any case after walking 10 minutes I felt stupid and just called a cab instead of taking the metro ,0
8194, Poor housekeeping service Housekeeping staff were not able to understand English Difficult to explain your needs ,0
8195, The bad part is the location a taxi driver was in shock when he brought us back from the centre of paris he said the area was very dangerous and it felt like that too ,0
8196, This is no fault of the hotel or staff but immediately outside the hotel were people sleeping rough in vast numbers and therefore felt very uncomfortable and unsafe It was at times like walking through a war zone ,0
8197, Just the neighborhood is not so nice the way walikg to the metro we pass on places with garbage everywhere ,0
8198, Location of hotel is not the best hence the reason there s a security guard,0
8199, However the way to that about 10 minutes walks isn t the most pleasure one with some poor families living under the bridge in front of the hotel My family and I didn t had any problem but you you have concerns with security I don t recomend ,0
8200, the location I would suggest the hotel to put a tip on their website on how to reach the hotel from the metro station when we first arrived we obviously have no idea which route we should take to reach the hotel and thus ended up walking pass a very dodgy rough and unsafe area more so when you walked at night,0
8201, The location is very poor There are homeless people living on the streets between the subway station and the hotel No taxis at the subway station you have to walk through a rough neighborhood There are prostitutes in same area Saw some fighting going on so we changed the street we walked on The view out the back from our suite was a vacated crumbling set of buildings with graffiti etc No Eifel tower views from my window ,0
8202, Location felt unsafe walking back from the metro at night under the underpass Would not recommend this Fine if you re travelling in a car as this hotel is right on the edge of intersecting motorways Not good if you re using it as a base to explore Paris attractions Stay somewhere else ,0
8203, Nothing to say all was good,0
8204, As you may have read from other reviews this hotel is not in the heart of town although it s close and you do walk through a less privileged part of Paris It is not far to get into town once you reach Porte de la Chapelle metro station but it is a decent 10 minute walk to the metro in a less than picturesque part of town this may be unacceptable to some people but we managed Let s just say I wouldn t feel comfortable walking back from the station after dark unless I am in a group of 5 guys There are no restaurants takeaway food outlets nearby which was annoying so if you want to venture around Porte de la Chapelle metro station we found a great cheap and nasty pizza place near there Gym needs to have some weights and a bench Aircon was not cold enough for us and we would have liked some bowls and utensils and proper cups vs plastic cups I suggest you look on google earth google maps before booking if you are a bit precious with where you stay ,0
8205, very bad service the door card did not work twice have to go down from 7th floor to the service disks staff members don t feel any sorry about the door card did not work no sorry don t care customer s feeling,0

8301, Room to small which was difficult to navigate with 2 large suitcases Our room wasn t made up till about 4 30 in the afternoon even though we had been out for at least four hours earlier in the day ,0
8302, In relation to the view from the room was originally given a room in the basement window faced a wall Asked to move which they kindly facilitated and got a slightly smaller room on the 4th floor so I could see the sky but was looking out on a flat roof As they said the hotel was busy there wasn t much choice so I was happy that they moved us ,0
8303, Very small single room and an even smaller shower 2ft x 2ft square difficult to get in and out at my age 75 I am glad I was not obese To get to my room was by lift and stairs Not easy with a suitcase Staff helped,0
8304, The rooms were quite small even though we had a club room In particular the bathroom it was really small and the sink you couldn t even get your head near to brush your teeth and the tap that was on the sink was huge ,0
8305, Nothing not to like,0
8306, We were not happy with the room it very small fortwo people it was difficult moving around each other as well has having our things in the way ,0
8307, There was an issue with pre payment authorizations however we did contact the hotel directly and they resolved the problem promptly,0
8308, None of the windows in the hotel open which can be a little stuffy in the rooms This isn t down the the hotel though as the building is listed and they can not change the windows ,0
8309, We were booked into a Superior room but the bathroom was accessed down steep stairs and that small that it was in my opinion dangerous ,0
8310, The furniture needs a bit of renovation Wanted to have their breakfast but the kitchen smell was all over the dining room So went to out ,0
8311, Views from windows Always ask for rooms with the view on Main Street Otherwise will get noisy neighbors and some kind of warehouse that starts business 6 00 in the morning ,0
8312, I m glad that I booked this room for 55 instead of close to 200 on the hotel s website ,0
8313,No Negative,0
8314, The only thing that bothered me was the size of the room With 2 people you couldn t pass each other That said all the good things and especially the location compensated this ,0
8315, The room was TINY for the price The room was only big enough room for a single bed and someone to stand next to the bed The window wasn t much bigger than a computer monitor and was in the top corner of the room similar to what I d imagine a prison to have I was on the very top floor it felt a bit like an attic room Great staff but just wouldn t stay again as I wasn t comfortable in the room ,0
8316, Room was so small and bathroom was even smaller Showering resulted in everything in sight being drenched no workable shower screen and pathetic shower headlike ,0
8317,No Negative,0
8318, The reception are not polite and some of them don t know what to do when they meet up with any kind of problems Definitely I ll never ever stay there again even still water is not available in this hotel When you ask reception that can I have a bottle of water You will got right away this answer We have got glass in the room and you can drink tab water believe me never try tab water Tasty like stream water honestly it was terrible staying Even if you want to leave one day early they will never refund your money back You have to pay exactly how many days you think at beginning ,0
8319, could not get the TV to work not overly concerned Room small but I guess that was to be expected and sufficient these are only minor items,0
8320, The bathroom was tiny you could sit on the loo clean your teeth and enjoy a shower all at the same time not enough room to swing a cat I had to use the public toilets on returning to the hotel to collect my luggage and unfortunately it was down a flight of stairs and wasn t clean it smelled of stale urine not good ,0
8321, The room was tiny which was a surprise since it is not a cheap hotel We were told we were given an upgrade I cannot imagine what we were supposed to have Also the shower screen was ridiculously skinny which defeated its purpose The bathroom mirror has a function whereby a part of it does not steam up The demisted part was too high up the mirror for me to see myself thus defeating the object once again There was very little thought put into these issues On the whole I feel we would have got more for our money at premier inn ,0
8322, liked everything ,0
8323, I paid for Club rate and the size of the room was tiny couldn t properly fit 2 suitcases in it Additionally there was only a really narrow small window A friend who paid for the same rate got a basement room with a terrible smell The room bathroom was not well cleaned and necessities such as shampoos soaps etc were not re filled added during our stay I am pretty sure that sheets were not changed either during our 4 day stay The carpet was poorly laid on top of an older one in a very obvious way Staff was not consistent with clients for example the same request book a room for an extra night had 2 different responses from 2 different staff members we cannot please book through the website and yes sure ,0
8324, The room doors don t have any padding to slow them down so during the evening everyone coming and going sounded like they were slamming their doors ,0
8325, Hot sandwich from room service was cold Tiny room but this is typical for London especially a single room ,0
8326, Service from reception entered my room without announcing and knocked on my door at 11 15 at night and cost of breakfast ,0
8327, The room was very small and it was an upgrade I am a tiny person and I felt a little clausterphobic in the room The bathroom was incredibly small I would not recommend this hotel to someone who is on the larger side ,0
8328, sizes of room and toilets ,0
8329, The room had no windows which I know the hotel had no choice on but still did feel a bit suffocating Small issue though not a deal breaker And if they could only find a way to fit a mini bar in the room ,0
8330,No Negative,0
8331, The room was the smallest room i had ever seen It was a struggle to manage to clamber around the bed and not at all like the advertised photos The was a chair in the room pushed under the table but as the end of the bed was behind the chair it was not possible to pull the chair out to sit on It was then a hinderance makibg it more difficult to get around the other side of the bed ,0
8332,No Negative,0
8333, The rooms were tiny This was a deal breaker I do not recall seeing sizes when I booked but I acknowledge they may have been listed at that time I know they are listed now because I looked it up If we could have pivoted and stayed somewhere else we would have but it was not practical From what I can see all the hotels in this area had similarly but slightly larger rooms The single induced claustrophobia We usually all meet in a room to discuss plans etc That was impossible in this hotel ,0
8334,No Negative,0
8335, They tried to move us to another hotel citing maintenance issues We refused and a room suddenly became available The rooms were not as grand as the reception area ,0
8336, Being double booked and asked to leave being rebooked into someone else s room and receiving no compensation for time lost and stress and inconvenience ,0
8337, the shower sprayed water everywhere ,0
8338, Rooms a little small but to be expected for the location and price otherwise fantastic ,0
8339, Noisy both out on the street and in the hotel Double bed was two single beds together ,0
8340, Deluxe twin booked A big deal made on checking in that we were getting upgraded to superior A bit insulting when we saw the tiny room with the twin beds with no gap between them If that was superior I d hate to see deluxe What on earth is standard like ,0
8341, Nothing to fault,0
8342, Our room it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in it was not suitable for two people or fit for purpose I booked a Superior Double Room it was not a double and definitely not superior I had to lay on the bed if my husband wanted use the bathroom I have stayed in many hotels including in Paris and this is the smallest by far When we arrived at the hotel approx 9 30pm there were people in front of us at the desk who where been called taxis in order for them to be moved to a sister hotel due to maintenance issues which can only be construed as an overbooking issue Also we had to wait for our room to be fixed cleaned as it was not ready when we arrived so late in the day although we did receive a free drink in the bar for our inconvenience For the price we paid it was not value for money ,0
8343, The room was very small and quite shabby and tired looking The actual building itself is beautiful but the decor is very tired looking and scruffy in places Our tiny room looked over the back of the hotel and was of rubbish skips that had overflowed onto the path so not very pleasant to look at In view of all this we felt it was very overpriced ,0
8344, The room was on the 7th floor tucked away at the end of a corridor by the staircase therefore quite noisy until late at night The room was the tiniest room that I have ever stayed in and I travel a lot to London and abroad The regular size double bed filled the entire room with hardly any space around it to manoeuvre I literally had to shimmy down the side of the bed to get into it and also in order to reach the bathroom The room was advertised as a superior double but in my experience it was only standard and due to the small capacity and lack of space would be better utilised for single occupancy The photographs within the booking details are misleading ,0
8345, When I landed in London I received a call from Grande Royale Hyde Park booked via your website They informed me that they had maintenance issues and that they transferred me to another hotel with the same rating After visiting another hotel Paddington Hotel which was more distant from the Hyde park and looked like it should have 2 3 star rating I went back to the Grand Royal and demanded the room Magically the room was available About 30 smaller in size than the one I booked Towels with hair on Sorry its far from 4 star Disaster ,0
8346, The only problem i felt was the double room was more like a single room so when i asked 2 be moved they were helpful 2 accomodete us with another room ,0
8347, By room could have been a little cleaner There were stains on the walls and on the lampshades ,0
8348, The room wasn t ready when we arrived fair play we were given complimentary drinks while we waited it s just a bit irritating paying all that money I wouldn t then expect to wait plus my friend is heavily pregnant so that made it more annoying and difficult for her after a long journey ,0

8353, Double room was a little cramped and would have preferred a bit more room but we had all the facilities we needed for a short 2 night stay ,0
8354, Our room was incredibly small The hotel rooms look lovely in the photographs but in reality seem a little tired and run down We paid a very reasonable rate for the room through Booking Com which was reserved several months in advance but we noticed that the general prices closer to the date were hugely inflated at prices that could not be justified for what you actually get Also the communal toilets in basement Not great when group of rowdy young men burst in when wife alone ,0
8355, We had booked one night in a twin room but were told on arrival that they only had doubles Staff offered a discounted second night as compensation but we were unable to take them up on this so still ended up paying the not insignificant full cost of the room for an uncomfortable night s sleep sharing a bed,0
8356, Tiny room and bathroom so small that the door couldn t open properly due to toilet behind it Lots of noise coming from outside and view of bins and rubbish from room window ,0

8362, My room had an insect problem but that was quickly resolved It s other things such as the drapes hanging off the rod and the dirty wallpaper and carpeting that were concerning The shower sprayed the whole bathroom impossible to contain without a bigger glass panel or shower curtain It is a lovely building but needs some upkeep inside ,0
8363, I paid for a superior room and the room was the size of a small walk in wardrobe The shower didnt have a curtain soo the floor gets completely soaked Their large towels are big enough to dry a young child It was ridiculous,0
8364, The room was on the small size as well as the en suite Did not see a tip box for the staff as I would have most definitely liked to have given the staff something they were absolutely wonderful which made up for the room being on the small size ,0
8365, Good location with easy access to Queensway underground station Although our room had been recently refurbished and comfortable it was referred to as a Club Room but was very small Friendly and helpful staff but the property could do with a major makeover ,0
8366, Bedroom and bathroom where on the small side but we didn t really need any more space as it was only a short stay,0
8367, Twin room is tiny with very little natural light No hotel parking available ,0

8390, Small rooms specially when have babystroller Had stairs in the hallway and in the room not ideal for us ,0
8391, Small bathroom but was enough for the stay ,0
8392, Poor room facilities Says on their website you have an iron in the room but you have to request it Rooms are TINY For a 4 star to not have any room service is poor Has a fridge which was empty No guest service book had to guess how to even call reception I travel a lot for work and would not go to this hotel again ,0

8394, Double booked at Hotel and Hotel has yet to refund me me the cancelled booking Have disputed double charges with my credit card company and the issue has yet to be resolved in my favor ,0
8395, The first room allocated was a lower ground room which was dark and very small We relocated to room 508 which was the same size as the first ie very small We hardly had room to move around in what was advertised as a super delux room Both rooms were smaller than you get in a modern budget hotel at twice the cost Room 508 did not have a ventilation system in the toilet this was corrected after I mentioned it Also the complete sink tap system had come away from the wall I guess it did work ,0
8396, Wifi is too bad I was at room 602 club room most of the time I could not go through This is quite important for me traveling for business otherwise I have to use my local carrier which cost me a lot as it is international ,0

8400, The rooms were very small just a bed and enough room to walk around it Good thing we didn t need to spend a lot of time inside our hotel rooms other than to sleep ,0

8402, My sister will soon be having hip surgery and getting up the steps to enter the hotel was difficult for her as there was no handicapped access ,0

8404, Rooms very small Bathroom tiny but very clean and modern Hotel is very old and needs new carpets Wonderful wood decor but needs refinished It could be a beauty I probably would not go back ,0
8405, The size of the room could be greater but our criticism on this point is minor You could arrange for a common pot for tips The staff was excellent but we were told that one only pays tips to a given person for services rendered e g porter I wanted my tip to be placed for the benefit of all the staff ,0
8406, The room was so tiny we could hardly believe it even after an upgrade to a bigger room It was smaller than our bedroom at home The view from our room overlooked a backstreet loading bay for a nearby restaurant takeaway which instantly took the edge off having a room upgrade I couldn t help thinking what view we would have had from the smaller room The pictures online of the reception lounge area are bang on it looks lovely however the rooms are nowhere near what is shown The advertised rooms must cost an absolute fortune I ve spent over 100 less per night in London for bigger rooms better views and the same facilities The overall experience nowhere near justifies the cost ,0

8414, The hotel was a total disgrace in all aspects my bag in the luggage cart was stolen right under their nose when I was checking in What s more disappointing is the hotel s response regarding the incident I had little to no help from them even after complaining about their poor service The hotel only helped call a cab but then abandoned us at a police station far away around midnight Before leaving the hotel told us that they will provide roundtrip service Even after requesting for pickup from hotel twice no one came to get us After the incident no employees or mangers reached out to us as if nothing occurred We had to insist managers to meet us when they did they were neither condolence with our loss nor try to help us in anyway They were utterly rude and did nothing but wasted our precious vacation time As guests of the hotel the hotel has responsibility to ensure our safety including our belongings Even if hotel can t replace my stuff at least could offer help in any way rather than being immature and heartless ,0
8415, Not sure about shower screen it wasn t big enough to stop the floor from getting wet,0
8416, We booked a twin room only to arrive and find out that there were no twin rooms available At the end the receptionist could find a room in a sister Hotel nearby which apparently was bigger than the one we booked Thus they wanted us to move again the next day which we refused since we had unpacked everything We booked a Club room with club Lounge Access from booking com However we found out that the Club Lounge was open to the guest only upon availibility At least one of the days the Lounge was busy all day and not on use for the guests ,0

8437, The Room was very small The shower was poor The breakfast was to expensive the channels weren t working in the tv I won t be staying in this hotle again,0
8438, Maybe not understanding why booking breakfast at Reception attracted a 3 discount Why make paying guests jump through a hoop Fair enough for non guest But the hotel has already collected 130 So not a customer friendly policy does the hotel need the 3 difference that much ,0

8445, We thought the room was a bit smaller than we expected but nevertheless was very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for our one night stay and did not include things we didn t need or use such as posh note pads and mini fridges A trouser press for the men would have been useful after all there was a hair dryer for the ladies ,0

8563, The furniture in the room was a little worn The desk chair was leather but with a lot of slits and missing leather from it it just felt a little tatty I would also recommend extending the shower door protector screen out a bit further as using the shower to wash hair meant the bathroom got soaked No ironing board in the room though ,0
8564, Nothing bad it was as described and can t fault our stay,0
8565, Room 106 was like a broom cupboard with a staircase above it From 6am no sleep due to the noise But we were moved after an early trip to reception Thank you ,0

8574, There was no iron and ironing board in the room The coasters were cheap and flimsy The room we was first given had a steep stair case on entry which wasnt appealing ,0

8578, Got there room didn t have not heating or hot water didn t have another room so put us in their sister hotel 10 mins away which isn t as good But still charged me same price Not happy at all,0
8579, The facade of the hotel was being repaired I understand that it had to be done but I would have liked to have seen it I must return ,0
8580, Could not get access to WiFi Room was small for price For the value breakfast should have been included Bathroom looked basic I have stayed in Travel Lodges that have better bedroom facilities,0

8582, There was building work being carried out and scaffolding,0
8583, Rooms a little on the small side bathroom even more so In fact it was so small you had to go outside to change your mind ,0

8589,No Negative,0
8590,No Negative,0
8591, The most small uncomfortable bed we have ever experienced for a double room along with the small room and a bathroom that was that small my head hit the ceiling in the showers and you had to climb down the side of the toilet to close the bathroom door to get to the sink and have privacy ,0
8592, Lot of building works and bteakfasr quite expensive at 11 99 for a 7 year old,0
8593, The room was tiny looked over the back of the hotel It was really noisy early in the morning because of the Bin men The bed was very small too soft ,0
8594, Bedroom far too small and difficult to move around bed Shower screen too small which meant we had to use towels to wipe toilet seat and floor dry,0
8595, We had a up grade to bigger room was wandering how big our other room was as up grade wasn t big at all also the decor needed up dating and repainting of doors especial bathroom which need a bit of gloss on it so it could be wiped in 516 also we reserved room with one debit card and wanted to pay with another but 2 days before we arrived they took money out of account which made me over drawn and then when we checked in they wanted payment for room so we payed with another card and was told it would take 5 days to process my refund on to original card this actually take longer than a cheque clearing so they had two amounts of money for one night stay not happy about this ,0
8596, The hotel wants to position itself somehow in the upscale but it s not up to that and fails ending up being awkwardly in the average Where in facts its real positioning is ,0
8597, The view was terrible An alley with skips and rubbish It was covered by broken blinds taped to the window Fire alarm at 7 30am No one came to tell us it was false alarm or to apologise for the inconvenience Staff just took payment don t do anything else like ask how was stay etc ,0
8598, Tiny room Small bed Dirty toilet upon arrival Dirty walls from scraches Small menu for in room dining No slippers and bathrobes in the room they brought them after my call Old room needs renovation ,0
8599, The room was very small for two persons The bed very small The bathroom is not existing ,0
8600, The room was supposed to be a double superior but not big enough for one Too small Not easy to negotiate with stairs to the toilet The bathroom too small had negotiate round the basin to gain access to shower Too small Very uncomfortable ,0
8601, Could be more selection on the food menu ,0
8602, The hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and therefor there were areas closed and sealed off there was demolition signs and danger signs all over there was scaffolding up all over the front of the hotel the room wasn t clean the bed was stained and ripped the carpets were stained and there was damp on the walls a very disappointing stay,0
8603, Basement corridors could do with repainting floors in reception need redoing ,0
8604, Nice bar but the barman wasn t very friendly ,0
8605, Some of the towels and sheets were not changed due to my stay There were few marks on bedding so wasn t replaced ,0
8606, I thought the dullness in the reception area gave a poor first impression lovely building so lets see it,0
8607, On arrival at 10 30 at night no room was available despite having rung and confirmed the previous day and we were sent to a tiny room in an inferior hotel This is the second time this has happened me with this hotel group This is totally unacceptable particularly with a short break when time is valuable ,0
8608, Y,0
8609, Due to restoration of the building the restaurant was not open although there is no shortage of restaurants and bars near by ,0
8610, Bed a bit too hard and pillows a bit too big but that is just our preference,0
8611, Rooms facing the back were a bit noisy probably because of the external units of the air conditioning but it was manageable Rooms are rather small but this is common for London ,0
8612, Rooms small and our children were placed in a room round the corridor which was away from our room we had asked for rooms close by breakfast waited 20 minutes before having to ask for coffee and tea crowded breakfast room and guest who had pre paid for breakfast were turned away,0
8613, Room was very small didn t look like the photos and there was construction going on during our stay which we weren t aware of ,0
8614, Quite cool in the reception area needs heating or an open fire to compliment the building No hot water for a shower on the evening or the following morning staff were very very good and issue with the above was resolved but put a dampener on the trip ,0
8615, Rooms are tiny i think you should be v clear on that Charging for a bottle of water on our second and third night is not good as it cost us one thousand euro to stay there the least i would expect is fresh water every day ,0
8616, The rooms were very small advertised as a superior double room but it s more like an average bedroom And for the amount paid you would definitely expect a little more the room was so cramped and I felt as though the bed was too big for the room there wasn t enough space to pull the stool out from the vanity mirror draws as the bed was in the way and there was only one side upon could access the bed from Honestly I was very disappointed with this hotel and probably won t be returning to London for a short stay again and if the other hotels are like this I definitely won t it s awful that hotels can charge that much for a room and it be that small Not sure if I may have looked wrong however the photos on the website showed a 4 poster bed which when I purchased the superior double room I expected to get and if what I got was a superior double room I would like to see how big a suite is Another point would be the view I wasn t expecting a lot from the view because obviously it s not up high it s you average house size however The view was very poor however it s understandable that they can t change this but again for the money you pay you would expect a little better One rude female member of staff at reception See first paragraph you don t get what you pay for at this hotel not sure if this is the case throughout London however it is here I am almost 100 sure that I booked the hotel room and I received free breakfast for both myself and my partner however we did not receive one and the female member of staff I previously mentioned was quite rude about it and told me that we had to pay 15 each if we wanted it also of your thinking of site seeing I wouldn t recommend this hotel as it s quite far from the main attractions like the London eye or Houses of Parliament and the Thames but there is a tube station round the corner which was helpful ,0
8617, The photos are enhanced on the Internet as in reality the hotel is very very dark inside and if I m honest a bit dreary From outside it looks really poor and needs a paint and clean of Windows It needs sensitively being freshened up throughout The decor is not consistent so a bit hit and miss Bedrooms modern but not comfy beds or pillows sadly Perhaps we had the smaller type room and should have upgraded We had very little space in ours that a glass fell from the bedside table and smashed as you could not move freely I wouldnt stay again ,0
8618, Unfortunately the hotel had boiler problems and we were move to another in their group The Grand Park Paddington 1 2 Devonshire Place Which was not where we wanted to be ,0
8619, The room was very very small so a couple with 2 medium suitcases is not very easy to move around in the room The breakfast is a basic typical hotel breakfast I would expect a little a bit more than that ,0
8620, Room was a club double but a little small The issue with the room was that the hotel had no hot water on the morning of our departure so I endured a cold shower and my daughter did not have one ,0
8621, club rooms slightly small especially shower toilet smaller than expected,0
8622, Nothing ,0
8623, One thing we found strange is that you had to reserve the time you will go to take the breakfast from the day before or you might not find a table and will have to wait ,0
8624, Hotel is dated Hallways are marred and marked with luggage collisions Construction in progress on the entrance side of the building ,0
8625, Bedrooms very small but ok Also when renovations complete I would think the hotel will be even better ,0
8626, Room was tiny Designation of double superior suggests at least adequate size but it was easily the smallest we have ever stayed in Little more than 12 inches either side of the bed and not being able to open the wardrobe door is ridiculous ,0
8627, Had amended booking but they didn t have the amendment had to wait for reservations to confirm even though I had proof restaurant far too small had sittings for breakfast so had to book time but they still couldn t accommodate us at the time and there was no room to pass tables Walls thin could hear all toilets flushing and showers running from above below and either side ,0
8628, The layout of the bedroom through the door and immediately down five steps to the bed not good if ur unsteady on your feet Also the floor boards in our room and the one above squeaked quite badly ,0
8629, They were renovating at Xmas time scaffolding out front and fireplaces not being used and lounges pushed together We had booked many months beforehand and were not advised of this Should have been offered discount and given opportunity of going elsewhere Also toilet hard to use as it was too close to basin and shower I was very disappointed,0
8630, I was transferred from the original hotel I booked They couldn t provide a twin bed and I asked for a room with windows instead I was given a basement room They complementary phone didn t work ,0
8631, Dont go here if you like to spend time on your room go here if you sleep in the hotel and you re out the whole day ,0
8632, Nothing in particular Room a little on the cool side but not uncomfortably so Some of the decorations a little on the tired side but this is an old traditional property Would recommend and have no hesitation in staying again ,0
8633,No Negative,0
8634, THE OVERALL LOOK OF THE HOTEL WAS A BIT NEGLECTED THE PICTURE ON THE WEB DID NOT REFLECT THE IMAGE THE STAFF TRIED TO HELP BUT SOME FEEL SHORT WHERE AS SOME WENT BEYOND SAY WHAT YOU MEAN DO AS YOU SAY ,0
8635, Ordered a taxi from reception and they they did not know where they were going abd had not hear of the Ritz Do not order Uber cabs for guests ,0
8636, The reception staff mundane lethargic not welcoming they need customer service skills they are the only thing that i found wrong with this hotel With the exception of an Asian male receptionist who smiled welcomed people ,0
8637, Room is rather cosy but perfect for a short stay comfortable and reasonably priced,0
8638, What they call a double bed could even fit 2 27 year old adults in Dent in middle of matress Fire alarm went off Both rooms we had were so cold and drafty The whole room was so small when going to the toilet you could hardly sit down The hotel it s self is lovely but the rooms are far to small and beds for what we paid I have never ever left a review but feel in this instance it is necessary ,0
8639, The room was not upto standard carpets stained and the walls room door would not lock radiator was not working and lose We only got told the radiator was not working till after we complained as well as the door told to put the chain on we raised our concerns health and safety as the radiator could come off to be told its acceptable thermostat not working set on one temperature Hairs all over the bed that was not mine partners I asked to change rooms which they did at no extra cost the new room was alot better but still Hairs on the bed So had to shake it off Went out for a meal and heard a conversation with another guest with the house keeper saying they had no room service that day it did not give us a good impression of the hotel Will not be going back to this hotel ,0
8640, I didn t like not knowing about scaffolding and non working fireplaces Also the printer was out of ink the entire time we were there and impeded our printing tickets etc ,0
8641, The room was very small thi s made it difficult to walk around the bed without catching your leg on the bedroom furniture,0
8642, There was mould around the bath The bath wasn t clean there was someone else s hair all around it,0
8643, They are renovating also a good thing ofcourse But the staff did everything to please us ,0
8644, Room Size We were upgraded to Club Room which was one of the larger room sizes This room was still very small incl the bathroom Exercise care when selecting room size ,0
8645, Rooms are very tight especially the front door couldn t swing open bigger and was a step down from the corridor floor some more Difficult to pull my luggage in ,0
8646, sink in bathroom too small and plug let the water out because it didn t fit properly Bathroom could have been a bit bigger ,0
8647, No need to change towels daily but no way of saying please don t Having fair trade branded tea coffee sugar in room would be a great plus for me ,0
8648, It was quite a small room clean and quiet but with not a lot of space Overnight it was very cold We asked for and received an extra blanket and a heater on the second night but shouldn t have needed to ask for it ,0
8649, The London weather ,0
8650, The room was tiny It was so disappointing considering I booked a superior room As soon as you opened the door there was 6 steps leading up to the room There is approx A foot and a half distance between the edge end of the bed and the steps Lots of renovations going on the front and inside the hotel ,0
8651,No Negative,0
8652, Room was small but manageable we weren t visiting to spend time in a hotel room so it wasn t much of a drawback ,0
8653, The room we were in was small compared to other Hotels we have stayed in Also mentioned to reception as I left fingerprint marks were on the bathroom door and the door jamb maybe needed wiping down as part of the room cleaning process ,0
8654, The hotel rooms are quite small They were clean but in need of decoration The entrance foyer and dining rooms are tired and somewhat dated and the breakfast while okay is expensive if not included in your rate We didn t like the fact that upon arrival we were told we couldn t have the rooms we booked and they were on 2 different floors We booked these rooms over 2 months in advance We were given a complimentary breakfast in compensation but our stay was spoiled by not having the rooms we requested meaning my daughters had to share a double bed I would not rate this hotel as a 4 star it s a 3 in my opinion ,0
8655, Felt very deceived by this hotel booked a room at the grand royal to be contacted to be told we would have to move hotel we were being moved away from the original location that we booked the hotel did provide a taxi to take us to the new hotel but the room in this hotel grand Paddington court was a lot smaller and very cramped I would not of paid the price we did for the room if I had seen it before hand I feel this hotel is intentionally deceiving customers by allowing them to book the grand royal knowing that they will be moved on arrival would not recommend at all Bathroom was ridiculously small and the room was not suitable for a family of 3 Would never use this chain of hotels again,0
8656, Bed was too small and the property was loud This was the only property I used a debit card in and on return to the US someone in the UK area cloned my card and used it to withdraw cash Not recommended ,0
8657, View from room was of a wall wasn t made aware of construction of building and change of room before arrival which was disappointing,0
8658, Lady rang asked if we wanted room cleaned we said yes but she never cleaned that s ok we asked at reception they said she must have picked me up wrong but yes means yes at the end of the day so we said just leave clean towels for morning but they didn t arrive unhappy about that ,0
8659, The room was tiny really small it barely fitted the bed in it really The window was not very secure or soundproof heatproof was old and breezy But my main gripe is that on arriving I was told I have to provide a credit card I didn t have the same card on me as I booked with so embarrassingly had to use my partners however despite the hotel being paid for in full they then charged my partners card without telling us for the full amount When I got home I noticed that I had been charged twice and I phoned them up which took over an hour of being kept waiting on hold to be then told that yes there is a mistake and it will take 6 days for the money to be returned to my account It would have been a nice stay but it was marred by these issues ,0
8660, Very basic and ungenerous place without feeling Having a drink in the bar and reading newspaper Staff member dimmed lighting at 11 35 pm Really rude Towels grey instead of white Bedding low quality You just feel like a package being pushed through a system on the cheap ,0
8661, Shower involved high step up and over which was cumbersome for this older traveler ,0
8662, The room was absolutely tiny the smallest I ve ever stayed in My boyfriend is 6 3 and they put us in a room in under the eaves The night staff and staff who checked us out seemed so disinterested MTV was playing in the lobby which did not suit the decor or 4 star status We were also not informed of the renovation works being done The whole facade is covered in scaffolding and the fireplaces in the foyer are covered over with big sheets of a plastic and one is completely blocked off with sofas The building work outside woke us up at about 8 30am this may have been acceptable if we had been warned prior to our stay or even when we checked in but it was not mentioned at all and this is really good enough Our stay was not that of a four star hotel ,0
8663, Scaffolding outside the building due to renovations and fires in reception were not lit ,0
8664, we weren t advised of the renovations taking place at the time of booking the facade was covered by scaffolding and sheets which made the reception and rooms dark The rooms are very small and claustrophobic the rooms we were upgraded to on 2nd floor had flimsy paper blinds that failed to open and those that did provided an unpleasant view of the backyard of neighbouring flats and bins However the rooms we moved to in the basement 003 and 004 were much more spacious ,0
8665, When we arrive the hotel we 3 rooms for 7 nights were asked to move to stay at another hotel because water warmer in our bathrooms don t work Without prior notice and without any other option even the booking has been done about 1 2 months in advance we were very disappointed It was unprofessional and unacceptable even the new hotel was not bad but we were inconvenience with its location far from tube station ,0
8666, No tea or coffee replaced on our second day but that was soon rectified by the front of house staff,0
8667, We were first shown Room 624 which was so small It should only be listed as a single CERTAINLY not as a double But we asked to be moved and they showed us a couple of rooms and one was much better So I cannot fault the service The bathrooms are fabulous best I have ever seen However the pictures on the web site give a very different impression of what the hotel is actually like Very clever photography gives a very false idea of the size of the main areas The bar and lounge areas are tiny and not big enough to accommodate the amount of people that could potentially be staying there We came back in at around 10 30 pm and there was only one space left for us to sit at in the bar area Others came in later and had to stand Unfortunately for us the hotel is being refurbished at the moment so wasn t looking at its best with scaffolding covering the whole building and many features inside were covered up with settees and flower stands removed Which is a shame as it is a beautiful building All in all a nice stay but not a great one ,0
8668, Although the breakfast was lovely due to the size we were asked to state a time for which we wanted to take it This was a little difficult but it didn t affect our stay we would use the hotel again ,0
8669, I had the best experience ever Thank you ,0
8670, Small rooms Confusion at my check in could not arrange me a room due to maintenance problems Offered me to stay at a hotel nearby After 30 mins they manage to sort me a room at their hotel ,0
8671, The only issue was that the duvet was too light and too small for a double bed So we had to keep the heating quite high to compensate The bathroom was small but had a bath The room was clean when we checked in but the quality of housekeeping in the subsequent days was not the best They never cleaned the spot of toothpaste that fell on the sink counter The check in process was a pain We arrived at 1 30 so 30 minutes early than the check in time so the room was not ready That was ok and we decided to wait in the hall No one ever came to tell us the room was ready and after 45 minutes I had to enquire and the person at the check in desk did not know and had to go and ask someone else When we finally got the key 5 minutes later we had to wait another 5 minutes to get our luggage which they insisted to put away instead of leaving it with us in the hall Overall the experience was ok and the price quality good for London ,0
8672, Small room very unkept in the decorating side pealing paint and at the back of the hotel so very noisy,0
8673, The fact that the room we had booked was out of service and we were sent to a smaller Grand Royale hotel ,0
8674, Room very old wallpaper coming off wall and covered in marks carpet coming away from wall and where joined together Bed very hard and uncomfortable bathroom very small but has been updated Terrible smell coming into room through air con vent we phoned reception who said they knew about it and were trying to fix it but we never heard anything disappointing This hotel is not for us ,0
8675, Wouldn t stay here again after all the trouble we had got to the grande royal hotel about half 10 at night in which they said to us oh did u not get a phone call because aparently half of the rooms didn t have hot water in which they offered us a drink and taxi to a sister hotel On arrival here the hotel was no where near as nice and we felt we had been fobbed off a little bit totallly dissapointed we went to our room which was nice and comfortable the only problem was after the first night we wanted room service in bed for our second morning and to watch tv turns out this hotel couldn t even provide us with the basics as the wifi had gone off all the phones had been cut off and the TVs were shut down with no signal on the screen Totally dissapointed I made sure staff where aware on our last morning I took it upon myself when I got to the sister hotel to trip advisor the grand royal as my partner had booked it as a surprise for part of my Christmas present on reviewing these it seamed the hotel since September had been selling the same scam story about hot water issues and plumbing Avoid ,0
8676, Booked in October for a better deal and found that on the night of staying in January it was around 20 cheaper Staff unhelpful when informed basically couldnt care less Rooms were far too small as was the bathroom which had rusty nuts on light fittings and hairs on cups and in bathroom Back of bathroom door was very dirty Very disappointed so went elsewhere for breakfast Definitely won t be staying again in this very tired hotel ,0
8677, see above window looking out on the rough side ,0
8678, There was no fridge within the room we stayed in and the room was quite small Also we found the breakfast room way to small we felt we were sitting on top of each other whilst eating our breakfast temperature was far too hot ,0
8679, Building work under way but was not informed when we booked For food only breakfast and snacks no lunch or dinner in the restaurant Floor boards in room all loose and very noisey and shower screen to small so all water went on the floor ,0
8680, Initially we stayed in room 235 We couldn t sleep all night due to the extremely loud noise from the pipes It seems that there is a problem with certain rooms this noise However to credit the hotel when I complained the next morning we were moved to another room which was perfect ,0
8681, The room was tiny and not enough storage for 2 suitcases and clothes in wardrobe more like a single room with a bed for a double room Reception was ALWAYS busy so always a que building works affected aesthetic and breakfast room use yet but price still the same snacks limited etc in bar and served in packets not expected for star rating ,0
8682, The room was not cleaned properly The tables were soiled and food on the floor after the room was cleaned Not very thorough ,0
8683, The attitude of the staff during the check in The assumption that I wanted two single beds even though I booked a double room How the attitude of the staff changed when they found out we were a gay couple So called technical problem with the room I wouldn t recommend staying here ,0
8684, Even though Im a genius and booking com said no deposit would be taken and no prepayment was required the hotel still took out a deposit from my credit card prior to arriving ,0
8685, Room not very big limited space between bed and wall Small wardrobe Front of the building covered because of repair,0
8686, Probably the smallest double I have ever stayed in If this was a superior double I would hate to see a standard room I couldn t use the safe as there wasn t enough room to open it ,0
8687, We arrived at 2 15 and our room was still not ready so we waited in the bar for 40 minutes until our room was ready which delayed what we were doing that day by over an hour ,0
8688,No Negative,0
8689, Room was super small Very very loud you could hear everything outside the hotel and inside Very uncomfortable bed ,0
8690, When we arrived they told as that they didn t have any room available and they asked as if we wanted to stay in another hotel they had We said no we had booked this room 2 months ago At the end they found a room available in the basement with no window etc we didn t accept and then by miracle they found one available on the 6th floor The rooms are very small,0
8691, Rooms were too warm at times The bedding only included a duvet and no top sheet Shower was extremely small with very low water pressure ,0
8692, The first room the gave which it was on the 6th floor its was like a grave and not even a room it was really shocking then they moved me to the basement which it was a bit better room it was no 016 but the 1st room I didn t recall what number was it ,0
8693, The bathroom was tiny ,0
8694, The room was so small for 2 people We had to take turns putting our suitcase on the bed to get things out and hanging our coats on the one chair made it so tight getting to and from the bathroom Our room had a horrible smell of damp which was very unappealing unable to get any fresh air in the room so it was very uncomfortable ,0
8695, I don t see how any improvements could be made to the quality of the room cleaning services and position of the hotel I would definitely return ,0
8696, Really straggled with the pushchair as there s no disabled access ramp at the entrance and our room was at the ground floor so we had to lift it again ,0
8697, Surly unhelpful staff and no room available Reception staff economical with the truth regarding reason for unavailability Frankly told lies most unhelpful Would never go near the place again,0
8698, The hotel was clean our room was small for a club room and it was on the lower ground so no view Had I been Informed about the scaffolding and work being done in the main dining room I would of looked for an alternative property for our stay This was disappointing as it was a special evening I booked for my wife as a surprise ,0
8699, Property is not quite a 4 since it needs some renovation No mini bar in the room ,0
8700, Rooms are rather small still one has everything he she needs ,0
8701, My room was tiny had to shuffle sideways around the bed the bath bathroom were tiny felt I d paid to stay in a cupboard we will NEVER go back there ,0
8702, No water at all when needed even to flush loo due boilerwork No offer of compensation or change of accommodation Found nibbled biscuit on floor Delux double very basic with view of scaffolding No response from hotel despite 2 emails to manager Very disappointing experience ,0
8703, Some rooms are tiny no room for big luggage or movement or without a window Towels could have been bigger and there are no robes or sleepers No ventilation in the bathroom and the waters were running out from the bath ,0
8704, The room was tiny we had an upgrade to a club room at check in as it was bigger which was very nice of them the superior double room must have been like a cupboard if this was the case Feel like 160 odd was a bit steep for a small room Shame about the scaffolding on the outside but that couldn t be helped ,0
8705, The double room is rather tight and there is no space for large luggage or movement in the room Rather disappointed no robes or slipper or shower cap Complimentary bottled water is given on 1st day but not on subsequent days as compared to other hotels that I have stayed ,0
8706,No Negative,0
8707, the room aren t that great the pipes makes a lot of noise during the night which didn t make us sleep really well,0
8708, The room was very cold the radiator did not work The TVs channels didn t work The front door did not lock A lot of the switches in the room didn t work I asked for an extra blanket calling room service twice as they forgot and they brought it an hour later ,0
8709, My boyfriend and I wanted to spend a special Christmas in London and decided to splurge on what was advertised in pictures a lavish London hotel The room we received was nothing like the pictures advertised It was very small and very plain the decor was very outdated and looked like it was from the 70 s or something The breakfast was 15 pounds per person which is ridiculous The staff messed up my room payment which made the check in a nightmare The bar staff did not know how to properly make drinks Overall I was thoroughly disappointed with the hotel Our room looked straight out of a Motel 5 and was so small we could barely move around not exaggerating we could barely move This was not a supposedly a 4 star grand royale hotel I will never go back here and do not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a lush place to stay in London For the amount we paid we expected a lot more Its not as advertised ,0
8710, Our room was in the attic I think It was very small indeed However we didn t explore other options and it was cheap so we don t take it personally Room a little tired and should really be sold as a single ,0
8711, The superior double room was small There were no bedroom slippers n toothbrushes The cloak cabinet were tiny like a budget hotel There is no space for large luggages There is no fridge as compared to the twin which has a fridge Complimentary bottled water given during check in but not for subsequent days of stay ,0
8712, The place was nothing like the picture on the website We requested a crib for our baby and they gave us a baby playard and a blanket After they put it together we didn t fit The room was underground no view the heat didn t work and the bed uncomfortable I didn t even bother complaining since it was only one night but I regret not spending 20 more Ando going to a better place ,0
8713, The room is extremely small and the double bed barely fit Ultra small wardrobe combined with compact space made living from large suitcases quite uncomfortable ,0
8714, Tiny rooms old and smelly having work done inside and on the front which wasn t aware of when booked so appearance wasn t great Didn t like the stay ,0
8715, Restaurant to serve meals rather than just sandwiches Ice creams were advertised as Ben and Jerrys but were a different less well known make ,0
8716, Upon arrival we couldn t see hotel only scaffolding very disappointing nobody told us about renovations Reception staff very helpful but overall hotel is very tired rooms not at all like pictures paint flaking duvet cover didn t fit bed net curtains dirty I would say a rating of 2 3 at most such a shame as staff were so nice ,0
8717, I didn t feel safe within the hotel and unfortunately had problems on the night of my boyfriends birthday as a man who wasn t staying at the hotel was very drunk We he to get staff to come redo the bed sheets which was really embarrassing finding pubic hair on our sheets The hotel did do us a upgrade as we was scared the man that was very drunk threatened us The police was called sadly it did ruined our night and the upgraded room wasn t special enough to save our trip personally I wouldn t recommend the hotel I had saved to take my boyfriend to London ,0
8718, Nothing negative to say,0
8719, We didn t get a room on our first night apparently there was a problem with the boiler so we had to go to a sister hotel called the Metropolitan hotel This was very inconveniant given that we lost a lot of time getting there and returning the next day In addition we didn t even know where they would bring us to even though we had to pay for the whole duration of our stay upon arrival at the Grand Royale The sister hotel did not meet our expectations either When we returned to the Grand Royale the following day we had to wait again in order to get our room All in all we lost a lot of time waiting around which was quite annoying given that we only stayed in London for two nights ,0
8720, The room was very small bed was small and bathroom was to small to get in couldn t move in there Also hairdryer wouldn t come out of drawer so couldn t dry hair well Not good value for money False advertising Expensive for what you get ,0
8721, The staff where so unhelpful telly broken complimentary drinks half drunk staff couldn t have cared less Very disappointed and I m not normally one to complain ,0
8722, Room was fairly cramped The shower screen was far too small water kept going all over the floor and the water wasn t actually on for the first few hours we were there,0
8723, Couldn t get a sit down breakfast in the resteraunt in the morning We had to perch on the small double in our room Single glazing and noise from the street made for an uncomfortable night Internet was intermittent the mobile phone inoperable ,0
8724, room was small and they gave me an upgrade ,0
8725, Nothing,0
8726, There are two truths to this property s description Yes it s in London Yes it s on Hyde Park This is where it ends The Grand Royale is no hotel It is a hoStel Whether it s the mouse hole rooms lonely soaring lobby or the other fooled tourists making life miserable for the teenage staff you will regret staying here The room wasn t clean the double bed accommodates two half people and the toilet shower and sink are located together in a phone booth Spend a few quid and upgrade your stay somewhere else ,0
8727, They state superior double room But not kidding it s a box size The 1st room had no space on one side of bed a day was 1ft space between foot of bed and wall We requested change they did but then 2nd room smelt of damp So 3rd time lucky ,0
8728, Would have been nice to have a ramp for our buggy and we had to leave our buggy at reception as it would not fit but that was OK ,0
8729, Sold as a family hotel when clearly it is not Steps to hotel no access for disabled or pram users Dining g area only had 1 high chair which we had to wait for,0
8730, Not being informed of scaffolding outside and fireplaces blocked up with polythene There was even a delivery of toilet rolls heaped outside Poor impression really ,0
8731, The bed was too small we are used to kingsize and concequently we don t sleep too well ,0
8732, Lifts rated as for 6 persons which could only accommodate 2 people with luggage before the overloaded alarm sounded But as the hotel was undergoing a major facelift this may have been a factor ,0
8733, They had our rooms mixed up and gave our key to someone else after we d checked in Another couple walked in when we were having a nap Not great Room are tiny however I appreciate that goes with the territory in London ,0
8734, Quite expensive from last time we stayed brother in laws room was cheaper that our by 40 00 and we had same room and staff could not tell us why,0
8735, Room is a bit small you could hear people walking on the floor from the top room all the time Staff however claimed that they would look into the matter ,0
8736, Hotel changed from the one booked meant a much longer walk to the nearest tube station I cannot accept that it was not known earlier that work was underway at the booked site ,0
8737, Expensive breakfast Small room and small bathroom Our room was on the ground floor but we had to climb some stairs with our luggage and no elevator,0
8738, the filthy sheer curtains in my room and the tiny night stands My view was pretty bad too Also there was scaffolding on the building which couldn t be helped but destroyed the atmosphere ,0
8739, The bathroom was quite small ,0
8740, The smallest room and bed i have ever stayed in I tried to request a change but the internet was down and they d get back to me which never happened ,0
8741, Upgraded to a deluxe double from superior or were we as it was extremely small unable to upgrade further which was disappointing Bathroom was a tiny en suite which was a joke Stairs inside room to the bed Room was unbearably hot air conditioning didnt work Staff arguing in the bar fire alarm set off staff unsure what to do Would not recommend this hotel ,0
8742, Bar area was musty smelling and the Sauvignon Blanc Chilean no choice was suitable for your fish and chips Rammed into the tiny breakfast restaurant admittedly due to current hotel restorations but just not great even after having to book a time to make sure it wasn t to busy ,0
8743, For the price the room was a little small but it was only to sleep in so it didn t really matter ,0
8744, Being woken by housekeeping staff talking for ages and very loudly right outside our door even though do not disturb was on display,0
8745, Club Bar coffee good but such a strange room to call a bar Its an internal room with no outside light ,0
8746, not told restaurant was being renovated or we had to book a table for breakfast so no room for us in the morning room very small and draughty no nice lobby lounge as on website as restaurant now there got charged for breakfast even though couldnt get in ,0
8747, Staff failed to warn about building work and we were disturbed by banging above The fruit platter contained a mouldy plum and unripe pear ,0
8748, Rooms very tiny and lower ground a bit like a rabbit warren ,0
8749, The room is too smaller than which we see on the website Especially in the bathroom I cannot even turn around ,0
8750, Work was being carried out which we weren t aware of the rooms were TINY very little space to get around the bed and the beds were small our feet hung over the edge despite having booked a deluxe room There was no decent public space to relax in either the theatre was freezing and the lobby was unappealing despite the lovely photos The cleanliness of the room was poor very dusty lots of marks on the walls and floor and the sheets had not been changed since the last guests The staff did try their best including moving rooms as the heater was making a noise in the first room but the move itself was very shambolic They did apologise and gave us complementary chocolates and wine but we shall not stay here again when there are lots of other lovely hotels in the same area for the same price ,0
8751, Bar could have stayed open a little later,0
8752, The room was of poor quality asked to be moved the did to a room that was just as poor the area where the put me up bed was damp the wallpaper stained had not been cleaned throuher it was a mess waiting for the manager to contact me with no effect had to pay for breakfast when I booked with you breakfast was included I can go on an on,0
8753, The first room we were giving was a basement room which was tiny and freezing as the window wasn t properly sealed which in December isn t great They did however move us to a slightly larger room which was nice and warm I thought overall it was very expensive for what it was ,0
8754, The value for place is absolutely ridiculous The price we paid was totally high compare to the standard received I would give this hotel 3stars minus just for the location The hotel charged mi 150 pounds before my arrival without saying what it is for I have of course paid fully for my stay at the time of check in so in my opinion this is overusing my credit card details,0
8755, Bedroom was the smallest I ve ever stayed in and apparently we were given a free upgrade to a Club Room God knows what the standard room size is like They accidentally booked someone else into our room and blocked our key card but apologized and gave us a free bottle of wine ,0
8756, Staff attempted to relocate due to maintenance issue but weren t prepared to pay for taxis Staff were unhelpful Waited 20 minutes for bags at departure and when asked they hadn t even given the ticket to the attendant Scaffolding outside Poor,0
8757, We didn t appreciate the hotel trying a bait and switch on us They tried to get us to move to their sister hotel using the same spurious maintenance excuse they ve been using all year it seems After making a loud fuss at reception a room was miraculously available for us after all ,0
8758, Grand Royale is extremely tired and run down for a hotel charging these rates Decor was extremely shabby and facilities were of a poor standard We had to ask to switch rooms as the TV didn t even work and we were told it couldn t be fixed Walls were marked in corridor and our room and stains on the divan bed This hotel is in need of either a huge refurb or needs to drastically drop its rates ,0
8759,No Negative,0
8760, It was the worst experience I reached there 12 am as scheduled but the reception staff informed us that there is no room available due to boiler problem They have waited till we reached the hotel to inform us that there is no room They never contacted us or phoned to say anything Moreover they have send us with a taxi to a horrible hotel with nasty smell and noisy AC which we couldn t use to heat the room so It ended up with a tiny electric heater beside the bed ,0
8761, We booked a superior double expecting something double and superior our room 711 was just a bit bigger than a large cupboard my wife and I had to squeeze against the wall for one another to pass we are not heavy weights we were not informed that the hotel is under refurbishment at the time of booking therefore not expecting the facilities to be severely limited and certainly not expecting the breakfast to be served in the downstairs lounge where tables are closer than Macdonalds restaurant There were many people complaining and the atmosphere for staff was not good and despite this they were cheerful and trying to please guests ,0
8762, My reservation was double bed deluxe however room given maximum I could say single superior and when I complain to the receptions they says hotel are full And no compensation was offered ,0
8763, Room small and smelt like drains stained bedding yuck Room 001 right by a staff door that banged every few mins from dawn Def not worth then money ,0
8764, I had a sleepless night at this hotel the room 807 must have the air conditioning system outside it There was a hum of noise from this system all night the equivalent of an idling car which was impossible to sleep through I won t be staying again ,0
8765, The front of the property was covered in scaffolding we were not made aware of this We were in the basement although nice rooms no view or phone signal ,0
8766, Renovation works in parts of the hotel were perhaps an eyesore but this didn t stop us enjoying our stay ,0
8767, The room was small but the character of the hotel made up for it in a large modern hotel you could wake up anywhere in the world and it would look the same not here you are in London ,0
8768, Everything but the most shocking was the room I paid 150 for a room that didn t had nothing to do with what showed in the pic disappointed ,0
8769, The building was a under construction arrived to find hotel covered in scaffolding staff then lied and said it weren t there s even though it was blatantly surrounding their building ,0
8770, Single rooms too many stairs items towel holders safes mirrors when foggy too high 5 6 people Wardrobe unstable no headboard 1 4 loo roll need sliding door to ensuite not enough space dangerous at night,0
8771, Breakfast not being included within the fee shown st the time of booking ,0
8772, Rooms were a little small and the bathroom could have done with a bit of a clean ,0
8773, The room was tiny extremely small and not well laid out at all There was no fridge for us to keep anything in and we only had water on the first night Not worth 411 for 3 nights at all and definitely not 4 ,0
8774, I ordered a bottle of Prosecco for my arrival we were delayed a check in by 15 minutes whilst this was organised then when I got to my room there was no bottle I had to call reception and wait 10 more minutes The pictures online make the rooms look MUCH bigger than they are to the point of being unbelievable ,0
8775, The room was a little cold responsive heating but had to get out of bed to switch on Room 215 window blinds did not move so could not see outside felt like in room without a window altho view was not good from the room nets or voile would have been better with working blind ,0
8776, the room was a little to small but we manged fine,0
8777, Nothing to comment that s right nothing at all very friendly staff beautiful hotel very accommodating will definitely stay again ,0
8778, The fact we got separated as a family we booked 2 double rooms and a triple room so we could all be together but rooms were split across 3 levels and a mother and 2 kids meant for the family room had to be split up due to maintenance in the family room that nobody notified us about so caused some upset for the kids could of been a bit more efficient as waited at least an hour of our time to sort this out overall,0
8779, I didn t like being asked to move hotels as they had a boiler problem I was also disappointed that the large lounge area with open fire which I had enjoyed on a previous stay was closed off and we couldn t use it ,0
8780, I read the reviews about how small the rooms are but did not believe how TINY it is until I saw it You literally cannot have 2 people walking around at the same time The staff are not fully informed about London and transport which was unhelpful for me as a tourist ,0
8781, The bedroom and ensuite were very small but well modernised Renovation work was progressing so the main dining room was out of action making the smaller breakfast room very crowded ,0
8782, My room was cancelled They offered me to move to another hotel i didn t agree so one night we spent in a small room in basemen The next day we moved on the first floor in a standard room ,0
8783, as i booked online well in advance the cost of the room was held on my debit card i paid by credit card but am still waiting for the amount stopped on my debit card to be unblocked iwas told it would be credit straight away dont think this should happen as i am not rich and need every penny so i am without funds at this time because of this,0
8784, There were building works on the outside of the building which we were not told about and found this very disappointing however having said that they did not affect our stay at all ,0
8785, Room service was only sandwiches although plenty of places to eat nearby,0
8786, bathroom was TINY shower was the size of a small phone booth you could barely turn around The room was so small there wasn t room for a chair for the small desk ,0
8787, Unlike every other hotel I have ever had to book for colleagues this one refused to take payment in advance over the phone which put me in an awful position they should say they don t take payment other than face to face on the website Awful customer service I was waiting on the phone for 40 minutes and then instead of even trying to help they said just come in ,0
8788, The building is under construction the rooms are small old a bit dirty Very than the pictures and various prices in different websites,0
8789, Lock on bedroom door was broken Exterior bedroom doors were filthy and everywhere looked like it was in need of a good clean redecoration and some tlc At checkin we were told we d been upgraded to a family suite The room was depressing and when we asked reception tif we could see the room we d booked we were advised that there weren t any available The upgrade was clearly a con We d have been much more understanding if we d been told the truth from the outset The family suite was a major disappointment dingy with dirty marked walls and carpet that looked grubby and threadbare around the edges Hotel was run down inside and not at all like the internet photos The bar was unfriendly and uninviting as was the furniture It lacked atmosphere and the carpet was filthy especially around the Windows The beds were comfortable but not sure why we had two single beds when we d requested a double When we mentioned the door lock to reception to be fair they removed my 5 00 beer tab from the bill My wife did not drink her unchilled glass of white wine and the rather surly barman reluctantly didn t charge for it which was appreciated No restaurant or room service We were very disappointed as nothing about this hotel felt or looked 4 Staff were pleasant enough ,0
8790, The first room I was given was 801 which is right at the top of the building in what feels like the attic and the water heater in was bubbling all night and I could not sleep ,0
8791, It wasn t the hotel I oringinally booked we were moved to this hotel Then I find out there wasn t enough beds so they wanted to move me a third time again but i refused They had a pullout bed which was only big enough for a child wasn t happy especially being there 1 nite stay and had excursions booked in ,0
8792, At arrival I was assigned to a room that looked more as a closet or pantry than a guest room It had a step right at the entrace and it was so small that two persons were not able to stand around the room at the same time Then we asked for a room change then we were transferred to a larger room not big with a bed barely capable to fit a couple of a standard size The lobby is depressing it seems to be from the Queen Victoria era ,0
8793, We got upgraded to a Club Room Lord knows what standard is like Room 222 almost behind a cupboard door next to a fire exit it looked like Room very small with the tiniest of windows which was frosted and when opened looked out onto a passageway full of air conditioning vents and old cars Bed has broken springs so every time one of you moves the other rides the wave Bathroom clean and shower ok but really poor value Bar closed at 11 and breakfast was a whopping 15 each we didn t have it ,0
8794, I had a Superior room which was probably a single in a past life very small Not great value for 168 per night Bar service was very slow as the barman kept disappearing ,0
8795, The room was a little small but that is to be expected in inner London To compensate we were within 1 minute walk to Hyde Park ,0
8796, Rooms small difficult to actually sit down at the desk air con didn t work properly ,0
8797, The bed was one of the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in and very small for a double Good job only 5ft 4 The bathroom was very small The shower was adequate but you could not turn in it ,0
8798, overall appearance of the hotel requires a little attention love the original character shame its not used to a better advantage Bedding very poor and room very small even in the Club rooms Decor bland and dated ,0
8799, The room size was small and the bathroom was extra small but we made it work out OK ,0
8800, The bed linen wasn t changed we were there for 2 nights also want that happy that on our little balcony we had a sex toy ,0
8801, The rooms themselves were far below average Extremely small with almost no room to move ,0
8802, Decor and condition of rooms dated and tired Very small room but I guess it is London ,0
8803, Arrived to find beautiful building in scaffolding Queues at reception and some guests being moved to other hotels Never did find out what the problem was but the chaos was not handled well by staff and there were sections taped off with no entry signs Had requested to check in one hour early but room not ready OK so they had a problem Won t hold that against them Asked to see room anyway as it was a very special occasion and I had upgraded to a so called club room Taken first to a tiny twin and was told the beds could be pushed together Asked for a proper double room and was eventually shown one but it was still absolutely tiny Frankly if I hadn t been on a time limit to get to the theatre I would have found somewhere else The bathroom as mentioned modern and clean was little more than a cupboard The room was VERY small and there was no natural light Windows were covered in permanent papery blinds to disguise outside bin store area We were told that it was one of the best rooms in the hotel but I don t see how it could be or how you could get smaller Just labelling the door Club Room is meaningless My basic beef is that I paid extra for what I considered was a very basic room Didn t have breakfast there After checkout manager emailed me to ask for feedback and assuring me he was there to help in any way he could I gave him feedback and two weeks later he hasn t replied Sadly would not stay again Booked it as was such a beautiful old building but what a disappointing experience ,0
8804, Bedroom was very small a foot between bed and wall window It was also very uncomfortable Everything was small shower area towels etc On arrival they tried to get me to move to a sister hotel ,0
8805, Rooms were very small and the noise from outside was clearly heard What sounded like fireworks at midnight a police car at 3am ,0
8806, A huge disappointment for me was the hotel is going through extensive restoration I booked this hotel after a great deal of research on the basis of staying in a historic building with British charm and character What I discovered when I arrived was the fact that the hotel s lovely exterior was covered in scaffolding the gorgeous public areas you see on their site were closed including the dining room This was not disclosed when I booked and I wouldn t have reserved if I had known in advance They requested full payment on my credit card when I checked in and I regret agreeing to that as I should have cancelled the booking and looked elsewhere So if you are expecting to experience what you see on their website you will be most disappointed ,0
8807, As an old building it s a bit of a maze walking around the hallways,0
8808, The staff in the kitchen lost it at one stage waiting for a time for coffee and taost,0
8809, Avoid G Floor I was in room 023 and got terribly disturbed by the smell of the food I guess it was from either the breakfast room or the kitchen Not good for resting ,0
8810, Small room couldn t open the window shower is small and when you take a shower it floods the entire bathroom no bed side lamp so either you re in extreme light or darkness bed is small there are cracks on the walls and they re falling apart Oh yes and no coat hangers,0
8811, We couldn t buy the breakfast we had been told they are to busy to supply all guest with breakfast it is rediculouse The bed linen was stinked Rooms are very tiny and toilet bathroom are so small you can t dry yourself after the shower no room for it The four stars on the website of this hotel is fake it is hardly three stars by UK standards I will give it two stars ,0
8812, Our room did have a window but we were not able to open it no daylight and blin glass Very small room and very small bed considering that 2 people should slep in there ,0
8813, The room was absolutely tiny Never stayed in a room so small and to think it cost almost 500 Euro is awful First night bed was so hard we woke up with pains moved room to a smaller didn t think it was possible to go smaller room we couldn t walk into the room together it was so small Couldn t walk around the bed without hitting the radiator and could touch the bathroom sink from the bed Awful size to call it a bedroom definitely would not return caravan would be bigger,0
8814, scaffolding outside the whole building I paid for a surprise visit for my father and was shocked to see the exterior without even being told Booked a twin deluxe room wasn t even suitable for a deluxe single room bathroom couldn t move bath toilet washbasin all squashed into a tiny room when the door opened it hit the bed Couldnt even sit at dressing table to dry hair Had to go to reception to ask for more coffee and milk sachets really poor Going to book breakfast but room was being refurbished although another area available The Hotel had a bit of history but sadly my visit will remain history it was really poor,0
8815, See above,0
8816, Bed was too soft,0
8817, Price is bit high for the size of the room per say BUT considering its located in only 10 minutes from Oxford Street and its right next to Hyde park its quite nice pricing They should have resupplied water on the second day as well No fridge available in the room No slippers provided Breakfast had to be booked and paid separately and rather pricey for a regular hotel buffet and does not offer an omelet they do offer fried eggs Breakfast was bit salty but that is just typical English style and it is rather subjective matter ,0
8818, Tried to have a bath one of the evenings I m pregnant and would have loved a hot bath after a long day but no hot water pretty disappointing ,0
8819, The room while clean and updated was very small I know that is not unusual in London but we were disappointed at that price point It was difficult to get out of the bed on one side as it was almost to the wall and no room for luggage to be left out and open That s really our only complaint Hotel has an interesting history and was fine for our needs ,0
8820, The stairs the poky room with more steps immediately inside to the sleeping area making entry with bags very difficult Small bathroom and lack of ventilation and a rock hard bed ,0
8821, EXTREMELY small rooms Look nothing like the picture If you take the lowest category you won t have any space left for your luggages Some of the staff were rude Other really nice No standards ,0
8822, Big queues so took a long time to check in Room was on the sub level so couldn t get a phone signal ,0
8823, Rooms are tiny with little space to move or place luggage Bathroom was the tiniest I have ever seen ,0
8824, Hotel has a number of sister sites nearby they tried to get me to move to a cheaper hotel because there was an issue When I said I reserved the right to come back and cancel without penalty if I did not like the new one They remarkably found a room for me in the original hotel ,0
8825, The location was not 1 2miles from the venue I was attending There was scaffolding covering the front entrance The road was shared with several hostel type buildings They let a colleague check into my room without ID and no reference to her name on my booking good job she wasn t a stalker ,0
8826, Some interesting characters at the adjacent hotels and apartments hanging outside in the evening Perhaps that s our fault for being outdoors after dark ,0
8827, we stayed when renovation work going on so shrouded in scaffold shame because it s a wonderful building Drawing room as in brochure being used as dining room so sitting area is in the entrance hall or bar ,0
8828, The twin room we shared was extremely small Would have been suitable for single room There was no way the room temperature could be controlled in the evening when the central heating was turned on The staff provided a fan to cool the room until morning when the room air con was activated,0
8829, Can t think of anything to complain about ,0
8830, The 1st room we booked was nothing like the picture despite ringing booking com and confirming that also upgrading the room through them Also getting to the hotel we paid a extra 100 for a family room upgrade which was ok so on the whole the room costed us 460 for a family room which was absolutely ridiculous as we could ve stayed in Mayfair for that price plus it was our anniversary weekend and wasn t pleasant at all will not be going back there again or booking with booking Com and either ,0
8831, Disabled access really needs improving ,0
8832, The building work outside our room was quite noisy which disrupted our mornings The rooms slightly too small,0
8833, I had booked online and was informed I could pay at the property The hotel debited my account on the Friday prior to my stay on the Sunday which I wasn t overly concerned with as I had no plans to cancel On checking in they asked for the balance of the room I explained that the money had already been debited from account and I was told that it was just to hold the room and I would need to pay again So in theory I have paid twice for the room I have been assured that the holding amount will be credited back to my account within 7 days But this not very good practice and would put me off booking an overnight break with this hotel again ,0
8834, 6 stairs straighr down into the room from the door If you have stair issues be sure to mention this when you book ,0
8835, Rooms are very old fashioned and small Bathroom is small too with an old and not a particularly practical layout i e glass shower screen was too small and as a result the floor was covered in water after using the shower ,0
8836, We got stuck in the lift twice which was quite frightening The bed we had needed replacing as the springs had collapsed The power points lost power one morning therefore unable to use hairdryer or recharge devices I think it should noted on the website that scaffolding across the front of the building could raise concerns of noise and inconvenience,0
8837, The account of my colleague who reported that there was a rat in one of the rooms The lift didn t work properly There was building work going on everywhere The place was dusty ,0
8838, The rooms could have been bigger The first room I was offered was very small more like a storage room insulting and really disappointing,0
8839, Fridge and air con didn t work We only realised as we were leaving so it s possibly fixed now No good coffee shops close,0
8840,No Negative,0
8841, The room is extremly small and i found insects in the room and the reception ,0
8842, Room was way too hot and couldn t adjust temperature because window fused shut ,0
8843, Rooms were really small which was fine for one person but I would find sharing a deluxe with another person really difficult There s no restaurant for dinner and after getting off a long haul flight it would have been nice to sit inside the hotel instead of wondering queensway ,0
8844, They claimed they had a boiler problem and hence could not honour the booking They said they will provide rooms at another hotel which was their sister concern also called Grand Royale and equally good but sent us off to Shaftesbury Hotel where we were asked to share one room for three persons for the first night The second night we were transferred to two rooms but they were so tiny we could not even open our suitcases plus there were awkward steps to get in and out of the room That hotel did not even have a restaurant except for breakfast After much complaining we were given a better room but nowhere near the rooms shown for the Grand Royale It appears that the Grand Royale London Hyde Park is used to attract bookings on booking sites and then people are sent off to a much lower standard hotel In my opinion they are confidence tricksters One guest had evened called the police when we were there in the lobby for the same reason The hotel was not shut as other guests were given and stayed in rooms Since I was with family and had a lot of luggage we had to lump it as it was already night They killed the joy and ruined our holiday ,0
8845,No Negative,0
8846, The hotel was having building work which was not advertised there wasn t noise but it wasn t as beautiful as expected due to the works The rooms were also very small,0
8847,No Negative,0
8848, We were given a tiny room where we could hardly move and tiny bed for two pearls we asked to be changed and we were given one slightly bigger but next to the breakfast room very noisy even at 6am besides the door of the bathrooom was sticky and I told them but never cleaned it The bathroom was like a box where one could hardly move inside and the shower as well they wouldn t make reservations for the opera and if you call a taxi there they send you cars with their own prices which were a rip off ,0
8849, Room very small Hotel overcharged significantly on sterling exchange rate and booking site kept giving diffetent excuses but never solved it ,0
8850, The rooms are smaler then photos but is a National Trust Old Building so it s worth it,0
8851, My requirements were ignored leaving my travel companion staying in the room I booked but given the light respiratory health issues allergies the bathroom smelling of cigarettes and the room being cramped left me with the an option not to stay at this hotel Did not want to go through the frustrating conversations at reception but would not stay again Definitely not value for money paid given the room on a ground floor where you can barely move around in and a smell of cigarettes in the bathroom ,0
8852, Staff disorganised Trainee on front desk who was unsupported and unable to check us in Rooms very small and some basement level smelt of stale cigarette smoke ,0
8853, Pricey for what you get and bathroom could get cramped at times couldn t have a shower without flooding the room,0
8854, The door into the room would not open fully because of the wardrobe The bedrooms were tiny one side of the bed was only 25cm away from the wall and a radiator was stuck out from that leaving 16cm up the side of the bed We had asked for larger rooms and they tried to charge us extra for this I refused to pay any extra as I couldn t beleive there were any smaller rooms ,0
8855, Bed was very uncomfortable fridge didnt get cold Wasn t really worth the money spent Would stay somewhere else next time ,0
8856, The staff was RUDE The air blew cool the first night but warm the second night The temperature outside was not low enough for heat When my wife called the front desk the gentleman was rude and condescending to her when she asked if the air conditioning was switched to heat or was there something wrong with our unit I didnt appreciate his attitude especially for the amount of money I paid The staff needs more training Don t plan to stay there again and definitely don t recommend this place,0
8857, Bed was small I m 6 2 but was given what we think is the smallest room Room in basement with no view and a noisy aircon outside ,0
8858, The room was very tiny I had to put my luggage on the bed to get my clothes The heater was not working ,0
8859, Liked everything ,0
8860, We waited 35 minutes to start the checking in process while the two out of their depth receptionists struggled with a handful of guests Despite the fact that we arrived late in the afternoon owing to a broken down train our room wasn t ready The guests lounge seemed to be permanently closed The employment of a concierge would have improved matters greatly ,0
8861, Was building works and scaffolding one floor below us We really should have been informed when booking or checking in especially as the workmen started at 7 30 ,0
8862, the room was super small and the bed was not comfortable the manager was nice enough to give us an upgrade to a bigger room but even that was too small to fit 2 adults and a one year old,0
8863, Room service menu doesn t offer much and luggage took forever to be located after I had stored it on check out since I had an evening flight Otherwise a great hotel more like home because of the warm reception ,0
8864, When we arrive after a long day we were told that I had booked two rooms which was incorrect there was only myself and me sister in law so we only needed one room We informed we would have to pay for both rooms until I spoke with an operator at your office and the hotel finally decided to cancel the extra room but for about an hour we were very worried that we had to pay for two rooms But got sorted in the end Also no airport shuttle so should say so on ads ,0
8865, The room was ridiculously small considering it was advertised as a superior double I couldn t find and information on what the hotel offered A tad run down and dirty The area a bit gritty but close to a tube station ,0
8866, book the club room which didn t feel like one The first room they gave us was on the second floor behind another random door which held 2 separate rooms The room was not well furnished despite the price paid One side of the mattress has collapsed I called the front desk several times and it was always un answered i went to the reception where they are awfully understaff and waited for a good long 15mins before I could address the change of my room I was told that it was the last room and I can t make any changes I was told to go for my dinner and come back again to see if they could do a swap When I came back they offered me another club room down in the basement with a window facing a neon bright light shinning right into the room every single night Thank god for the curtains The room was much smaller than the previous and reek of a mixture of dampness and new paint I was too tired and upset to even request for another room change ,0
8867,No Negative,0
8868, Nothing,0
8869, Rooms are really quite small which is OK for a couple of days but if you are staying for an extensive period it can be an issue ,0
8870,No Negative,0
8871, As previous reviewers have said the rooms are very small but for London this is probably typical Upgrading to a Club room provides access to the Club Lounge which has seating areas computers and a coffee tea station Breakfast is a bit pricey as we were able to walk around the corner to a great little cafe and have a wonderful breakfast for half the price ,0

8877, The breakfast was pretty good I wish the eggs were cooked a little longer It seems people in UK like their eggs runny Due to construction we were moved to sister property so we missed out on the character of the older property,0
8878, The room they gave me 104 very small and have 5 stairs between the bathroom and the bed It should not be used and kept as storage They changed the room the second dayafter I told them I will leave ,0
8879,No Negative,0
8880, Hotel is under repair our room was in the lower ground floor with no natural light and was noisy The 2 nd room booked for our friends was rather small but being on 7th floor they could see out of the window ,0
8881, Our room and bathroom and also the bed was very small for two people Not even place to put the cloths or luggage When you entered into the room you had to be very careful not to fell down the stairs as the room was on a lower level than the corridor Not very convenient When you opened the window you had depending where the wind came from probably food smell from all the restaurants around ,0
8882, The bed is a bit hard ,0
8883, Size of the room was a bit small though for such location and money it s not a big deal,0
8884, The size of the room was very small and I was in a Club Suite ,0

8889, The smaller room is too small The exterior view is not great,0
8890, Split level room with bathroom downstairs ,0
8891, Room Size I expect a Superior Double to be superior to something Not to be told that is the standard size in what I can only describe as a box room ,0
8892, Room was smaller than depicted No room for a chair just a small stool for suitcase Very tiny bathroom No space for an ironing board Room meant for a double but only suitable for one person ,0
8893, Superior double room was tiny difficult to get in and out of the room steps down with a suitcase Also no room to walk around the bed Bathroom also tiny Bath with no screen so when showering the entire bathroom was a big puddle The two lifts are small and one was out of action so the working one was very busy We had a train to catch so gave up waiting and struggled with our suitcase down the stairs ,0
8894,No Negative,0
8895, On arrival we were able to leave our bag and told our room would be available from 2pm Great we thought that all fits with our plans However this relaxed feeling was short lived When we returned to check in later that day we were met with a long queue that took 40 minutes to process before we made it to the front Only to be told the hotel was fully booked How we wondered could this be we d booked 2 3 months prior to our check in date and received confirmation our reservation had been confirmed We were informed that our booking would be honoured at a neighbouring hotel and a free taxi transfer would be arranged for us within 5 minutes 30 minutes later our taxi had not arrived and we noticed ours wasn t the only one that hadn t turned up So far we had been well over an hour A further 20 minutes later a taxi finally arrived and we were taken to a hotel only a few minutes away Needless to say the other hotel dealt with us promptly on arrival but all the drama at check could if been avoided if only we had been told upfront ,0
8896, I didn t have an opportunity to sample this hotel as they had a mix up as they put it and sent us to another hotel The staff there were rude as they spoke in a foreign language whilst resolving the issue so I didn t know what was going on,0
8897, The bathroom was fairly compact although useable The view from our window was of the windows of another part of the hotel but you can t have everything ,0
8898, The room was very small when I booked the room it was a deluxe single room but actually I could not move inside it ,0
8899, On arrival we were Met with a long que to reception when we did get served we were told they didn t have a room available for us due to maintenance work They said to go to the bar for a complementary drink and they would have a taxi pick us up and take us in 10 mins An hour and half later we were still waiting I asked them to get me a room in there hotel as other people were checking in They agreed and we ended up in a basement room which was very small Tv didn t have a remote to operate it either It definatley was not a four star room or experience We had to que 30 mins to get into the breakfast room When we did get in they had no cerial bowls so we had to use dinner plates to eat fruit and yogurt They clearly were struggling to cope as the beans sausage bacon etc was all depleted at different times Worst hotel experience for us for a long time Shame as we were there for my wife s birthday ,0
8900, The breakfast was too busy and we had to sit separately subsequently you were asking for coffee and items that were running out on the buffet ,0
8901, Room exceptionally small and could be construed as dangerous Room was in a very confined space with 10 steep steps down to a miniscule bathroom with only just enough to squeeze in and I am of reasonably small build ,0
8902, The pictures of the hotel rooms bore little resemblance to the actual room in particular the size of the room they were exceptionally small to the point of being claustrophobic ,0
8903, It is our honey moon and we requested specials to our room nothing was being done for us Extra small room for us while it says deluxe double room,0
8904, There were problems on arrival with our rooms we were asked if we could move hotels we selected the location to walk into Hyde Park the next day then the rooms were confirmed but only one out of the two rooms was made available by 6pm ,0
8905, we missed out on High Tea on our last day we left it too late the night before but it was booked out by then so book it early ,0
8906, A four star hotel I don t think so Just overpriced There was nothing special about it Just four very thin walls and a bed Lack of ambiance Super small shower cabine My neighbor called home after midnight could hear his entire conversation Glad we didn t stay for breakfast ,0
8907, Rooms very small having to pay in advance made you feel like they didn t trust you also the fact that no one told us at check in that we had to pay in advance resulted in an embarrassing position when we were locked out of our room On asking reception why we could not get in our room we were told in front of a busy reception area that it was because we hadn t paid I would expect to pay in a YHA but not in a hotel of this standard Ii have stayed in many hotels around the world and never have I had to pay in advance ,0
8908, We were phoned during the day of our arrival to be told that they had room issues and we were being moved to another hotel After explaining we had a car in a nearby car park and that we had all been enjoying the festival we were at in Hyde Park so could not drive we were told there would be rooms in the grand royal When we did check in we were asked to pay for the room despite the fact the hotel had already pre authorised the full amount which had already been deducted from my card This meant that I was now 600 down for a 300 bill Next came the rooms having booked a deluxe double room we were given a twin club room which was so small that two people moving around the room were constantly having to get on the bed or go into the bathroom to let the other past All through this staff were not very helpful and seemed to be basically clueless Having listened to other people checking in and out and all the other complaints at reception I can safely say I do not believe anyone had a good stay this weekend Very disappointing for a such a wonderful building in the main ,0
8909, The rooms were a bit small ,0
8910,No Negative,0
8911, Only issue we has was on check in We didn t have the credit card that we used to make the booking as the card had been cancelled Make sure you take the credit card that you use to make the booking This was sorted but frustrating Bed in our room had broken springs but this was quickly resolved and we were given a new room straight away ,0
8912, We booked a superior double room which on the whole was fine however if we had been staying for more than 2 days it would have been very difficult to store suitcases ect as room was a tad on the small side,0
8913, Trade off is the room is a bit cramped and the design leans to efficiency rather than comfort The finishes are starting to feel their age in the rooms themselves ,0
8914, When I arrived after 2 days of travelling I was told that my room would only be ready in 24 hours and that I should take a cab to one of their other hotels stay there for a day them repack and move back to the grand royale The rooms are all dirty dust on the skirting boards Rooms are painfully small bathrooms are so small you battle to even dry yourself after a shower Front office staff were abrupt unfriendly and seemed barely willing to assist with calling the manager One of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had in London ,0
8915, Very noisy area and noisy hotel Very small double rooms staff unable to help or call back regarding complaints no door man and no help with luggage upon arrival The room wasn t cleaned as well as expected ,0
8916, The bedroom was of reasonable size and bed comfortable but the shower was minuscule and the toilet difficult to access a larger person might have found it impossible to use There are steps at the front of the building and to some of the public areas handrails absent ,0
8917, The only thing I could think of was that its a bit pricy for what it was We booked this hotel because it was on offer through booking com at 53 off usual price otherwise we wouldnt have been able to afford it ,0
8918, The room was so small and dark it was unpleasant The shower was soooo small you couldn t move and I am not fat The worst hotel room we ve ever stayed ,0
8919, There is nothing I don t like about this hotel,0
8920, Poor single glazed sash windows let in draughts I would definitely avoid during cold weather and noise The neighbours on the opposite side of the street decided to party outdoors until 00 30 we could hear everything clearly from the 7th floor with the window closed Narrow corridors Difficult with pushchair due to steps doors although staff will help if asked Many steps including at the entrance in the corridors and even in the bedroom Expensive breakfast so many good cafes in 3 10 min walking distance ,0
8921, Mattress uncomfortable like it was old I could hear the tube till late view from Window was a concrete courtyard room very small and no parking even though booking com said there was Shower drenched the bathroom ,0
8922, room could have been bigger the bed was a little hard for my taste although it seemed good quality the 8th floor is not directly accessible by lift you have to go to the 7th and then up a couple of flights of stairs no minibar or fridge we stayed in a deluxe room ,0
8923, Unfortunately I saw the mattress when the cleaners were changing the room and there was a large blood stain on it put me off a little ,0
8924, A little faster check in ,0
8925, I had read several bad reviews about overbooking and sending people to different hotel but I took a chance I had requested and early check in and we arrived very early 8am Upon arrival I was told that a representative had tried to call me to tell me their was a problem with the hot water in my room and they had no room for me I quickly went into defense mode and told them that I had read this bad review about them and couldn t believe it was happening to me Desk manager told clerk to call reservation and let them deal with it She called and told them I had read a bad review and they found a room for me but it wasn t ready They kept our luggage while we went to breakfast and said I was high priority to get in our room We returned about noon and it wasn t ready so we sat in the sitting room and waited and waited While waiting I heard various stories to incoming guests about the water and high priority to get in Different rooms were offered as was free breakfast to other guests I kept checking on room progress and was finally told that the guests had just checked out and we would once again be high priority to get in We did get in our room at check in time and we had a nice room Club room was what it was called It was in the basement but clean and nice We had a few drinks in fridge and basket of fruit Tea and hot chocolate Upon checkout Two of us left early and one remained I stopped at desk and said that one person remained and I wanted to make sure nothing was owed as it shouldn t have anything Assured we were paid up When last guest left they tried to charge her for breakfasts every morning She replied that she was told that all was paid and assured them we had not eaten breakfast We weren t charged The hotel made things right by my reservation but I am not sure i would stay again Most of the staff was very nice and helpful ,0
8926,No Negative,0
8927, The bathroom was like a coffin and not a clean one at that The entrance of the hotel was lovely but the rest was awful you could have been in a Travel lodge and saved some pennies Very noisy at the front of the hotel ,0
8928, As the no disturbe ight was on at the room door they STILL called me in the middle of the morning to offer room cleaning EVERY MONDAY MORNING or so they said the hotel has a FIRE DRILL Advanced warning could have been great so guests are not scared to death when it happens and nobody answers the phone at the reception ,0
8929, Room was modern but very small for 2 people 2 lrg suitcase only 1 would fit lying down There was no lift very narrow staircase no porter also no fridge ,0
8930, Room could have been a bit bigger but it was enough for us for a short break,0
8931, Some of the staff is not fluent in English but they do try to be professional ,0
8932, The bedrooms are very small and the staff are too courteous LoL ,0
8933, Service on arrival felt that the staff member on reception was rude we arrived after 2pm and the room wasn t ready so we has to wait ,0
8934, Long narrow maze of hallways and repeating corners to access rooms ,0
8935, Booking through booking com did not give a breakfast option at 15 pounds per person times three people times three days this was quite significant booking directley through the hotel would have had breakfast included at the same rate,0
8936, Clean an tidy but rooms walls are dirty and scratched room were small check in was late and hotel stuff didn t feel brothered about it so at end of oure trip I m not happy about place were I stayed in But location is really good ,0
8937, I did not like being at the front of the hotel We stayed for a few days at the back of the hotel and returned from a trip to be put at the front Nicer view but no sleep as you can really hear the drunks shouting in the street,0
8938, The fruit bowl was limited There was only an orange banana and an apple ,0
8939,No Negative,0
8940, Nothing,0
8941, A tiny noisy room VERY deceptively photographed ,0
8942, Size of the rooms is small and I don t think management can now do anything about it ,0
8943, I didn t like the fact that the sink and bath wouldn t drain properly and would fill up and you would have to wait half an hour for the sink to drain ,0
8944, The room was a bit small the bathtub did not have a door or shower curtain so the whole bathroom got all wet from a shower also no fan in the bathroom the wifi was fine but not the greatest the USB port the room came with did not even work,0
8945, Big room Big bathroom,0
8946, We were given the broken boiler story too and they tried to move us to another hotel until I asked for the price difference to be refunded we paid 158 and the sister hotel was advertised at 107 we were suddenly found an available room at the current hotel Also the room smelt of drains sewage,0
8947, Tiny bathroom to be honest not suitable for the price of offer also very odd window blinds in our room meant there was never any daylight which i didn t like,0
8948, The presentation of the hotel is quite dark and dower the family rooms leave a lot to be desired saying it is small is a little bit of an understatement and also the room was very tired and needs total redecoration ,0
8949, I was sorry to leave but God willing I ll be able to swing by The Grand Royale before I leave ,0
8950, It took them almost half a hour to check me in and in that time 3 people complained who were not in front of me but were still served first I was ignored until I complained,0
8951, The room was very small There was hardly any room to stand between the bed and the window For the price we paid I would have expected breakfast to be included ,0
8952, Checking out ,0
8953, The bathroom was too small I m small and struggled but my 6 2 partner found it far too cramped The staff gave an arriving guest the wrong key our room number so we had someone opening our door in the morning when when we were getting ready and didn t really appreciate that ,0
8954, The shower screen in our room was not big enough had to point the shower head at the bathroom wall and be careful moving so that water did not splash off me STill ended up with a pool of water on the floor and the toilet Had a bath the next day to avoid the hassle ,0
8955, We ll typical of London hotels Small rooms though it s a 4 star Bathroom dilemma no shower curtain the glass division was soo small thats why when u take a shower the whole bathroom is wet There s a smell stink but tolerable this matter was brought to the attention of the management They offer us to transfer to other room we we re at the basement then ,0
8956, When we arrived for a late night check in we were told that we were being moved to one of its sister hotels 15 minutes away The boiler had broken in the hotel They did not call us in advance and advise us of this problem They also had us sign a paper committing us to full 4 night reservation prior to disclosing the facility s maintenance issues and being required to move We were then transported at 11 p m to the other hotel where we were told we had to pay for the full 4 night stay without inspection of the room or area At that hour we had no choice but to make the payment We were then stuck in a basement apartment and all of the attractions we planned to visit were a 20 minute rail ride away We asked to be moved to a higher level family room and they were unable to support the request We called booking com to express our concern but were only told that we were committed to the reservation and had to stay at one of these two hotels We then agreed to be moved back to original one with the preferred location Around 1 p m the next day we were moved back to the original hotel Although I was told by the hotel s management that the room was located on the 2nd level and was lovely and would comfortably hold a couple with an 11 year old child the room was tiny Much much smaller than most small European rooms Worse yet it was filthy dirty The carpet walls windowsills and pullout couch were obviously soiled The courtyard area where the room looked out on was filthy also with garbage laying outside We have pictures to support this description It was shocking that we were not released from the reservation We have used booking com in the past but NEVER AGAIN They should have helped us to find an appropriate hotel even if it cost us an additional investment ,0

8961, We were in a lower ground floor room with a window looking out to steps that go up to street level which was fine but the steps area had some building materials pallets etc lying there which could have been moved out of view Shower was a bit small but fine to use ,0
8962, Not happy with bookings com my reservation was excepted got to hotel and we had to stay somewhere else didn t have a choice in the matter as we had already travelled to London so there was no going back This wasn t the hotels fault ,0
8963, Rooms were very small and they only service the room for your arrival then after your departure Though in saying this i actually asked them to service it while we were out and they did Only other negative wos that they gave us keys to a room already occupied so we walked in on another couple ,0
8964, The bathroom coiuld have been cleaned a little better each day ,0
8965, Room was like a box literally no windows couldn t swing a kitten Very claustrophobic would not consider staying here again ,0
8966, The area isn t as nice as the hotel but beyond the hotels control,0
8967, Bathroom was VERY tiny Not even a proper sink No breakfast included ,0
8968, They overbooked the hotel when we arrived there was a large gap under the door which made us feel the room was lacking in privacy the bathroom was actually caked in dust under the sink I saw this because I dropped a soap The shower didn t have a curtain or screen so water gushed everywhere the shower head also didn t stay in place everything about the place felt cheap and budget the rooms are tiny and it felt unclean I would have rather stayed in a holiday inn or premier inn worst hotel I ve ever stayed at ,0
8969, Not all single rooms have a bathtub showers in some singles are very small by US standards normal for UK though ,0
8970, The bathroom was clean The 4 shower screen not a joke was hilarious and pointless and meant your shower contributed to a flooded floor each morning ,0
8971, Room was very small Also we would have loved to have dined in the restaurant but it is only open fur breakfast This is a real shame as I m sure it would be a lovely place to eat ,0
8972, Rooms far too small booked a superior room but nothing superior about it Bed was hard pillows were hard no sheets only a duvet that had seen better days Shower leaked all over the bathroom due to inadequate screen ,0
8973, I couldn t actually like anything as my partner checked in and was told we had been moved to a sister hotel down the road The entrance was more like a budget hostel the room was so tiny the bed was against the wall so we had to climb over each other to get out After a sleepless night we selected the table in the basement breakfast room with the least damp coming through the wall Absolutely disgusted at our treatment ,0
8974, We were moved hotels due to an electrical fault I understand this was out of the hotels control but the alternative accommodation was not in such a good location I d been looking forward to a drink in the grand looking reception area and a short walk to Hyde park ,0
8975, The room was not very clean and was extremely hot couldn t open a window We were upgraded but it was a tiny room with a small bed There were cracks in the tiles it was in desperate need of a refurbishment,0
8976, A very small room but it was clean ,0
8977, On arrival I was sent to another hotel down the road by the girl on reception as there was a problem with the boiler and my room was not available Although I asked for another room I was told there wasn t one that I would have to go to another hotel down the street for the first night that was of an equivalent standard When I got to the other hotel it was nothing like the one I d paid for and was 90AUD cheaper per night I asked to be transferred back to the hotel I d paid for they did have another room the gentleman on the desk was very apologetic This all could have been avoided was very upsetting at the time Fridge would be handy ,0
8978, Room very tight to work around the bed and bathroom tight Was expecting an iron in the room ,0
8979, Basement room disappointing not represented in the advertised pictures ,0
8980, Difficult to move around the room as the area around the bed was a bit tight ,0
8981, The new hotel was in an area where we did not want to be The hotel was fine apart from its location ,0
8982, No TV remote in room Single room so tiny Maybe I am naive but I still think 100 is a lot for a single basement room with no breakfast ,0
8983, Very small room eapecially as it was a club deluxe Very small bathroom could hardly move and staff customer service was not particularly friendly The reception area looked tired ,0
8984, The room size and access wasn t the best small with steep steps but it didn t detract from the positives I would still stay again,0
8985, Fortunately we are not big people other wise the bedroom would have been hopeless about 12incs around either side so my husband just managed it The receptionist suggested we mention this in future ,0
8986, To be honest our stay was a nightmare from start to finish We arrived at the hotel to be told that someone had been trying to contact us they hadn t and that we were being moved to a cheaper different hotel when we had picked this one due to its beauty My husband had to complain that we were still being charged the original price and being moved to a cheaper room so we were upgraded but the staff kept changing their mind about where we were going to be staying first telling us to move then that we were staying then again that we were moving We had to complain to get upgraded to a suitable room in the other hotel and the staff were disorganised and slow I am hugely disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary ,0
8987, Room and en suite were very small for two adults I lay on the bed with the suitcase to give floor space to my wife Standing in a bath on a non slip mat to shower is not acceptable nowadays Booking com not the hotel website lists parking beware this hotel does not have parking however I was directed by reception to a nearby underground carpark ,0
8988, Room was smaller than appeared in pictures and there were steps inside the room entry way which are a tripping hazard Interior of hotel is beautiful but worn in places ,0
8989, Room was very small and cramped although en suite was adequate Housekeeping staff slam doors constantly during the afternoon ,0
8990, The single room although they said they had upgraded it to their largest single for my birthday was still but rather small and claustrophobic very hot You would not want to linger too long in that confined space,0
8991, There was a slightly bad smell in the second room We didn t say anything as we were not in the room very much and were so glad to have the bigger room ,0
8992, Incredibly small room So much so that we were a a couple with two medium size suitcases between us and it was too tight to have both on a stand each and the two of us bending over repacking without bumping into one another Can t swing a cat Or pack a suitcase,0
8993, the lock on room door was broken window latch broken,0
8994,No Negative,0
8995, Very very small rooms A bit like sleeping in a cupboard It was all very comfy but very cramped ,0
8996, Asked for upgrade twin club got a double and at 11 pm had to try to split the twins and reset the room it was in the basement they offered to move us but after unpacking it was too much of a hassle they did give an apology note water and fruit in our room the next day,0
8997, Needs a smartening up of its appearance But then it s in Bayswater not Mayfair ,0
8998, Pillow and bed too hard and room too confined especially bathroom However upon request they gave me a soft pillow Nice if sports had been shown on TV but available at nearby pubs,0
8999, Small room with a small bed But slept well with extra comforter ,0
9000, Slightly small bedroom but I guess that is London ,0
9001, Rooms average size but had all facilities ,0
9002, Price is on the expensive side but you get what you pay for which is a fantastic hotel ,0
9003, Despite paying for an upgrade the room was extremely small There was only a narrow staircase leading to the first floor and corridors leading to the room were a tight squeeze ,0
9004, Rooms a bit cramped no fridge marked walls furniture in the room interfering works yard below the window,0
9005, Our room was tiny i found some difficulties moving around inside the room but I guess it was the value for money condition ,0
9006, There was some issue at the hotel and on our first night we had to sleep in a partner hotel of theirs Though the quality was good the atmosphere of the room and breakfast area were not on par and we did not enjoy it that much We did return to our original hotel for the second night and were happier there ,0
9007, I tried to ask the reception staff for restaurant recommendations in London which they seemed to know little about ,0
9008, They stuck us in the basement For 1 444 for 5 nights they could not give us at least first floor The wifi did not work in the basement very well so for a week I could not comfortably contact friends and family in the states after a long day The desk people were very snooty and the tickets they booked for shows and attractions we could have bought cheaper anywhere else Do not book anything with them or believe their advice on anything I had to figure everything out on my own very hard to do with no wifi They advertised an airport shuttle but no they do not have one false advertising Cost 45 00 pounds to get to the airport All they offer is a bed a bathroom and a pretty lobby The women at the desk seemed to not have a clue about anything in their city and seemed quite content to just stand there and give bad advice Maybe if you looked like their next suger daddy they would fawn all over you but if you are a woman from the USA Forgetaboutit ,0
9009,No Negative,0
9010, I was extremely annoyed that the bill did NOT add up yo the number of days times the rate displayed by booking com The rate changes as the week progresses WARNING,0
9011, The room was supposed to be a Superior Double room it wasn t at all The window wouldn t open properly and we complained they wanted to give us another romm but as we had so Little time there we didn t want to move as our days were planned You could hardly walk next to hat ebed to get to the window or get into bed For this price not including breakfast the Hotel was very unsatisfactory A terrible cheek I would definitely want some money back I would never go to this Hotel again they are cheats ,0
9012, Sunday morning breakfast manic busy Staff were great but other guests who could see people waiting just sat and enjoyed their 3rd helping of food guys it s not an all you can eat Other rude quests who think they are too important to queue at check out desk,0
9013, There were steps in our room right after you enter it Do request for another room if this is of inconvenience to you Otherwise this is a great hotel to stay ,0

9020, I stayed 2 nights all was fine Left to go to Peaks region When returned was notified my 2 night reservation was cancelled Was told by staff my credit card was rejected It was same card that was used 2 nights for earlier stay Had a hassle getting rebooked at different hotel Found out later from another guest that hotel had water leak and needed to move customers to different hotel Did not appreciate being told my credit card was the problem when clearly it was not ,0
9021, The room was too small and the linen had several pubic hairs stuck to the sheets which made feel very sick I am not sure if the sheets had been changed from the previous guest ,0
9022, The fact they took the money from my bank account several days prior to our arrival Especially when it was said we can pay at the hotel upon arrival And then having to wait days for any refunds to be put back into our bank account ,0
9023, For the price of 168 for one night to be told that this did not include breakfast was shocking although when I complained the manager did allow us to have breakfast Also the photos of a Superior double room on the website did not live up to the reality of a very small drab room where there was barely enough room to walk around the bed There is more room and comfort in a budget hotel than this and as it was a birthday treat for my daughter we were very disappointed We won t ever come here again and it was not worth the money I will go with the budget option next time ,0
9024, Sent to Park Grand Paddington Hotel Room was very small No cupboard space No fridge No iron Bed made in the am but bathroom not cleaned or towels changed No mini bar Very very disappointed Not given a discount considering we paid almost double to stay at the Grand Royale Hype Park compared to the hotel we were sent too for 2 nights ,0
9025, Be careful when booking the total I paid by far exceeded the sum of the days times booking com s price it went up and up each day quite unfair to a trusting soul who did not add up my own bill before clicking Warning to others ,0
9026,No Negative,0
9027, Room very small and we had to wait almost an hour for sandwiches when we ordered room service the manager did say sorry for this in the morning to be fair but no good to us as we were very hungry the night before we also went to the bar for a night cap and they had no bailys cream so we went to our room very disappointed ,0

9031, Invited to wait for our room to be ready by having a drink in the bar Waited 15 minutes for bar staff but no one arrived to serve us ,0
9032, The so called Superior Double Room that was booked turned out to be the smallest room we have ever stayed in for a hotel which was not satisfactory for the price we paid although on the door it stated Club Room and not a superior room Also we checked in at 11 00 hr and returned at 23 15 hr to be told that there was a minimum of a 1 hour wait for our baggage to be taken to our room when they had all day to do this knowing what our room number was once cleaned and available We also once in the room and the hour was up had to call reception twice to find out when our bags would be delivered ,0
9033, Room was tiny No where near what I would expect from a superior room Been in London premier Inn s that were literally twice the size ,0
9034, Paid for a double superior room but it certainly did not feel like a superior Had to walk down a flight of stairs to get to the bedroom and there was hardly any space to move around The price of the room was too much for what we had ,0

9036, Room was tiny Very disappointed Completely different from the pictures,0
9037, Price View from bedroom Over a noisy and untidy back yard ,0
9038, The staff never smiled and only ever said 3 words to me the whole time I was there I also got a poor view of their ventilation system For the money I paid I did not deserve a view of their ventilation ,0
9039, The room is way too small including the bathroom Lighting was also poor ,0
9040, We did have a small issue with the staff being unable to locate our luggage which was left with them on the day we were leaving This was resolved but still did worry me at the time ,0
9041, A little tired needs an up grade But must retain character Our superior room had little floor space no chairs to sit on no space by the bed You had to get on the bed from the front Surely you can t call this superior But still liked the overhaul character ,0
9042, The room is small and there s no elevator to the 8th floor ,0
9043, They left us outside of the room one day before check out because we have been told that we hadn t paid at the check in when they forgot to Ask us for the entire payment and asked for the first night After many discussions with the hotel manager we have been allowed access to the room They said they tryed to reach us via phone many Times and this is absolutelly false,0
9044,No Negative,0
9045, The room had all you would expect But v small and no natural light Expensive for what it was Had I had a better room I would have been v happy with hotel,0
9046, The room 704 was very small for a double The bed was barely a double and there was hardly any space around the bed There was a very shallow single wardrobe which was of little use The bathroom sink was so impractical that water went everywhere when you tried to use it This should not be classed as a 4 star hotel in my opinion The Reception staff seemed more interested in having a good time than in helping guests ,0
9047, I think we were downgraded to the basement even though booking was for a deluxe double The receptionist mumbled something about it when we checked in The room and en suite were tiny but clean ,0
9048, Room was far too small even for London standards You could not leave the case stand up as there was no where physically to put it a few feet more in the rooms would be less greedy this was a superior room ,0
9049, Had to change rooms due to being put in what almost seemed like a cupboard with no window and no room for our luggage being six months pregnant this wasn t acceptable as the room was very stuffy so we asked to change rooms new room was more spacious with a window but did have dirty marks on wall and very hard bed which was uncomfortable ,0
9050, Bed was uncomfy Room was very small even though I booked a deluxe Certain areas in need of decoration No extractor fan in bathroom and it floods when in shower due to small screen ,0
9051, Staff seamed very busy which caused them to forget about letting us know when our room was available so check in wasn t the time we expected which was VERY disappointing ,0
9052, Room was a little on the small size but adequate ,0
9053, Some minor maintenance issues no teabags on hospitality tray and curtain not hanging correctly so letting light in from early morning Some public areas in need of TLC Bar prices steep 5 for a Diet Cole and a Soda water ,0
9054, The room was very small despite being upgraded We did move to a similar grade room with a different layout but still short on space But never mind we were there to attend a concert and sightseeing London is amazing The black cab drivers were so friendly and chatty made us laugh ,0
9055, On the day we were to check in I missed a call at 11am letting me know that due to a boiler issue our booking would be transferred to a sister hotel in Paddington for our entire stay Having googled this boiler issue I found that many other previous guests had the same experience noting that in their experience this was in fact an overbooking issue rather than any boiler Upon arrival at the hotel I was told that a taxi would be called for us and we could check in at the sister hotel I asked if there was a member of management I could speak to about this matter I expressed my dissatisfaction and how the substitute hotel was not somewhere that I had chosen to stay I also cited the many booking com reviews about this boiler that I had found I was told that this was just something that happened to the 2 hotel boilers please note that guests were both checking in and out during this time After causing quite a fuss at reception the hotel found us a room in the hotel one would imagine that this would have been done in the first instance rather than relocating a guest However I was happy that my original booking had then been honoured ,0
9056, cockroach running across the carpet uncomfortable mattress rubbish outside the window being put in the basement shower so small you couldn t bend down to pick up the soap,0
9057, The weather but hey its England in summer ,0
9058, The bath shower water rained out onto the floor There was no shower curtain glass barrier to keep the water in the tub Caused more than the usual anxiety during use of the bathroom ,0
9059, Booked 4 rooms Double deluxe 1st room had obviously had smokers in Next room damp then settled for last room Very small not sure where deluxe was Also booked 3 other deluxe double rooms which were allocated to our colleagues when we arrived as they informed us of room numbers When colleagues arrived their rooms apparently had no hot water then rooms were locked and then had been given to other people They ended up in tiny single rooms not what we paid for They made us late for a very important appointment It seemed like this group of hotels were shipping people in and out of sister hotels Not at all happy ,0
9060, nothing,0
9061, The room size and the bed are quiet small but that s how it is in most London I feel terrible for big sized people fitting in is a hassle ,0
9062, Tried to move us to a sister hotel that was in a terrible location so we made them shuttle us back wasting about an hour Rooms tiny Staff rude ,0
9063, that is possibly the smallest room i have ever stayed in at a hotel and i have stayed in a few and we were upgraded to a larger room i really didn t think you could cram a shower bath and toilet and basin into 2m2 but they managed it It was nice and clean but it was absolutely tiny and given the cost isn t cheap it is a big let down from the main part of the hotel ,0
9064, Buyer beware Bait and switch They tried to switch my reservation to another hotel charge me the same rate but the hotel they tried to move me to was a lesser hotel that would normally charge half the price I saw them doing this to other travelers too ,0

9066, Rooms are very small ,0

9070, hmm the room appeared to be a bit smaller than we thought The interesting thing was that we had to climb a few steps after opening the door to a our room which is just enough to fit in a small writing desk a double bed and a bathroom the splash glass of the bathtub is too small We had to be carefully not to wet the floor Interesting experience afterall P,0
9071, Staff in breakfast area abrupt and no customer interaction or smiles Queue for breakfast took over 30 mins to be seated facilities are very small,0

9074, No porter at front door Hard for some drag big bag up ,0
9075, Our room was rather small We also had to go down a flight of stairs as soon as you open the door The door open in word and there was not enough room on the landing for person in the door ,0
9076, The room a superior deluxe was the smallest room I ve ever stayed in Very little space Two adults could not stand either side or at the end of the bed together More of a single than a double let alone a superior deluxe ,0
9077, I was very annoyed with the check in They wanted to move me to another partner hotel in Paddington due to problem with heating They rang earlier in the day suggesting this I completely refused and was eventually given a room in this hotel but I dislike the way this was done and it was almost a favour to give me the room I had booked ,0
9078, Tiny rooms Repeated requests to hotel staff to provide extra coat hangers which eventually arrived a couple of hours later Rip off prices in the bar 9 for a single gin and tonic No window able to be opened for fresh air Air con noisy This room was the biggest room I d refuse to stay in the smaller rooms Paid 180 per night but could ve got it for 120 if I d booked a couple off days before ,0
9079, It wasn t really a problem for 1 night but the bathroom was really small Very clean and well maintained though ,0
9080, Normally I am critical of London Hotels but this one has no problems at all,0
9081, According to the escape map behind the door i believe my room should be the smallest in this hotel there are even no place for me to open the luggage,0
9082, Description of rooms Superior Deluxe and Club none of them were applicable to the rooms we were shown The club room should be graded standard,0
9083, The room was tiny I am pretty sure they did not measure it accurately Always getting in each others way The bathroom was also a nook and not much hanging room ,0
9084, the room is fairly small compared to other hotels I stayed in London before the hairdryer is really old the rear side is widely open no mesh filter which is almost a given in any recent design I got a chunk of my hair sucked in had to ask for a scissors to cut my hair ,0
9085, Very small cosy bedroom bathroom ,0
9086, Everything Did not enjoy my 2 nights stay and wouldn t recommend to anyone I was on business so my company was paying if I had to use my own money I woukd give it a rating of minus 10 Not a happy customer,0
9087, Did not have any evening service in restaurant also the menue for room service was very limited,0
9088, I don t think guests should be offered a discount just to pre book breakfast anyone paying to stay should be offered breakfast at the same price ,0
9089, Small rooms I mean very smell we couldn t even walk around the bed and that s all the space we had Impossible to get undressed or move about Bathroom was even worse We did get a refund on our breakfast due to complaining about our room ,0
9090, There was no changing room or area in the toilets for guests who had already booked out and had baggage stored for the day ,0
9091, Don t be disillusioned by the pretty pictures Staff was rather rude to us and lacked complete understanding of english language None of the staff appeared to be native speakers Room was extremely small and we had to use a stairs to get from bathroom to sleeping area which also makes the space advertised as larger than it really is Even being a very slim person myself I couldn t reach the other side of the bed without moving the furniture Window could not be opened as it was half covered by the balcony wall and floor The air conditioning was very dusty ,0
9092, The superior room which we were supposed to have was a little small and the 6 or 7 steps down to the bathroom were a little inconvenient but not so bad as to spoil our stay ,0
9093, The mattress was ok but not as comfortable as it could be I cannot recommend this hotel for those with ambulatory issues because there is no access other than stairs at the entrance There were also stairs to enter my room but I understand there are other rooms without Otherwise a hidden gem ,0
9094, The price we paid for our stay we were disappointed with the room we thought it was on the small side and the bathroom was compact Also for the price I think breakfast should have been included ,0
9095, I cannot fault this hotel at all ,0
9096, The room was on the lower level and was very small and the bathroom was tiny The shower stall was 2 x 2 My 6 3 husband could barely stand up in it and it would have been impossible for him to raise his arms to wash his hair So ridiculous Not worth over 200 a night ,0
9097, Room was tiny and had to enter up staircase immediately inside room door and shower sprayed all over bathroom due to tiny shower screen,0
9098, The room was very small and the green security light over the door was much too bright I could not sleep because of this ,0

9104,No Negative,0
9105, The room we stayed in was in need of a bit of a refurb The wallpaper looked tatty and blinds were broken this was a little disappointing and I did contemplate asking to be moved However we were on a tight schedule for the day so didn t want to get upset over it Rooms are very small ,0
9106, the lavatory is incredibly small I was living in the room 114 which is a so called club room If you are a big guy and right handed you will absolutely find it difficult cleaning yourself after using the toilet,0
9107,No Negative,0
9108,No Negative,0
9109, On arrival had to wait to check in and was then asked to move to another hotel I firmly refused and was promptly allocated a room I asked staff to confirm my booking of a superior double would be honoured I was told it would be Room so small I had to climb over bed to get into it It was however comfortable and I will no doubt use the hotel again even though I am still not sure if the room I got was a superior double How small must a standard double be ,0
9110, I found the room a bit cold and the thermostat did not seem to be controlled from the room ,0
9111, The only negative is that the restaurant is not open in the evening but there are plenty of eateries nearby,0
9112, Towels were so rough they exfoliate with every use Sheets could use some fabric softener too ,0
9113, Noise from fellow guests unhappy baby next door ,0
9114, Nothing,0
9115, We were very disappointed in the size of the room even though we chose a superior double room also very disappointed in view from our window which was a very scruffy block of flats,0
9116, A room that was a matchbox for my money Superior room NOT Dirty nets Curtains dated Decor untidy paintwork shabby and marked scuff marks No water in room for a 4star hotel Website very misleading have you seen the rooms on the 7 th floor wouldn t put my pet up there Would not recommended this hotel even with my last breath I felt I wasted my money and time staying there it was disgusting for a four star hotel The entrance is one big front and not in a good way Shaftsbury Hotels Will not ever be on my list to stay in ever again ,0
9117, only a little point the shower screen in our room could of been a little bigger to avoid wetting the floor so much,0
9118, We had to wait around half hour for our room to be prepared even though we could check in after 2 we still had to wait Although the staff we re apologetic and offered us tea and coffee it was still a nuisance to wait longer The bed was comofortable unfortunately there was holes in walls and black marks on the wall that was a little disappointing ,0
9119, The room size and consequently the double bed were really small and somewhat restricting on movement so much so I could not pass my wife in any part of the room without one of us having to our move aside for the other The view out of the window was none existent as it was directly onto a wall less than 2m away,0
9120, The fact because we booked threw you and ndt the hotel direct we had to pay 12 each for breakfast even though the hotel says breakfast is free for all our guesrs,0
9121, Sheets were not changed even when we put in a request with the receptionist who said she would have it seen to We had spilled coffee and would have appreciated our sheets changed but they were not its the only things that was not perfect ,0
9122, aost perfect just a warning they re isn t a huge vegetarian cooked breakfast options no vegi sausages but there is lots if choice for other breakfast things so it s not a problem,0
9123, Room not as spacious as would have liked ,0
9124, A lot of stairs but the staff upgraded my room to a ground floor room Lifts do not go to all floors,0
9125, Nothing to fault,0
9126, the rooms are really tiny which does not make it a value for mony hotel ,0
9127, Room was very small decor rather shabby shower screen too small therefore floor got very wet ,0
9128, Staff that don t speak english well Seems to be the trend in London that the service industry is filled by eastern europeans that cannot convey ideas or understand queries Inconvenient small rooms with even smaller bathrooms Had a room on 8th fl which is reached via elevator to the 7th and then a snakey passage with steps Anyone over average size would not be able to move in these rooms and the hallways are claustrophobic The closet so small that 5 days worth of clothes wouldn t fit shoes had to stay on the floor behind the door which had a great expanse of wall begging for a row of hooks for coats and sundries Those we had to lay on the suitcase rest The desk in the corner was essential to laying things down the kettle and the hairdryer in the drawer however too close to the bed kept hitting my toes and hips on the corner It could have used a mini fridge underneath The last and most important thing for any hotel is a comfortable bed These were 3 4 beds Smaller than a double and HARD as rock I ordered an extra comforter to place on top It helped somewhat ,0
9129, room size very small bathroom you couldnt physically get in without having to stand over the toilet to close the door Bar very basic poor quality of towels bed sheets etc ,0
9130, Room was very small Difficult getting in and out the bed So close to the window View was awful ,0
9131, The room was absolutely tiny you couldn t even really walk The windows couldn t be closed so it was freezing cold and extremely noisy in the room Moreover the air con didn t heat the room either The furniture is old and totally worn down scratches and marks everywhere The Shampoo is a joke it s like it s gluing your hair together so you can t brush it anymore no conditioner has been provided Generally it s a very dark and uninviting hotel I don t understand why people rate it so high I will not come back definitely not 4 stars in my opinion ,0
9132, Creaky floors uncomfortable pillows leaking iron one staff member who delivered my iron when I asked does this not come with a board replied grumpily I was told to only bring iron and walked off in a huff to get an ironing board ,0
9133, Basement room so I was disinclined to open window for air Security wise Outlook awful also Noisy fridge buzzing away all night in cupboard beside bed,0
9134, Stuff poor very slow to check in The room very very small not as in the picture looks bigger and the bed very small for two The room was not very clean and towels really old and not clean well I will never come back to this hotel as all ,0
9135, Toilet was positioned so it could not be used for what it was designed for Therefore we had to go elsewhere to use the toilet ,0
9136, I don t like to complain but the room was on the small side ,0
9137,No Negative,0
9138, Bedroom was far too small and the bathroom was so small that you cannot get in without closing the door after you step halfway in Just no space and silly steps right at the bedroom door to get to the bed ,0
9139, The price should come down by at least 10 15 A little extortionate I thought ,0
9140, Place was a little noisey and the deluxe room was very small for the price The bed was hard ,0

9142, Well given it wasn t the hotel I booked I can t really say much about it despite having booked 14 days earlier and despite the hotel looking pretty busy I was shifted hotels because of a supposed boiler fault Not being a tourist and staying all too regularly in London hotels I realise this is code for we ve overbooked the nicer hotel and shunt guests to the quieter hotel round the corner after we ve filled all the rooms It happens too often for me just to be an unlucky traveller 180 for the room breakfast on top and a room that to be fair was tidy but certainly not comparable with other similarly rated hotels that I stay in ,0

9147, Upon arrival tried to shift our booking across to a sister hotel in Paddington no explanation why but we refused Given our triple deluxe room which was really poor Cramped room was tatty and looked onto a square concrete storage area full of drinking water containers Manager offered concessions in an attempt to satisfy Hotel is grand but room we experienced was 2 star ,0

9164, We had read some bad recommendations about this hotel usually redirects to their clients to other hotels overbooking for sure This was true As soon as we arrived they tried to do it I needed to confirm my pregnancy in order they took 5 minutes in giving as a room I think this is not very professional My husband also confirmed 2 months before that weekend was my birthday and their hotel was part of my present and nobody had any deference about it We also ask for an additional blanket on Sunday and we needed to call twice to Front Desk in order they brought it we had it after almost 1 hour ,0

9200, Room was a bit on small side but obviously you don t spend much time in there 4 50 charge for large bottle of water think that s probably normal for room service but tad overpriced in my opinion,0
9201, The room and bathroom are very tight impossible to walk between the bed and furniture suitcases on the floor Bathroom sink is ridiculously small With pullout bed in this suite there is no room to get around This is not really a hotel no dining room only used for breakfast The lobby sitting room is dark and not our taste Adam s family gothic Not a good sign to see people standing on the doorsteps smoking when we arrived Looking out the window of pullout bedroom window is no joy dirty and stack of empty water bottles ,0

9203,No Negative,0
9204, Ref Room 109 1 Strong noise specially from bathroom s ceiling spreading into bedroom at night seriously disturbing proper sleep Cause aeration system 2 Poor lightening system ,0
9205, Poor room location being on the basement and below ground level so didn t have much of a view Difficult to communicate with staff seemed to be due to a lanuage barrier ,0

9211,No Negative,0
9212, I was greeted with the information there was no accommodation for me that I would have to be accommodated in a sister property There was mild surprise I had not received prior Informatio but that did not ring true I politely but firmly refused alternative premises and guess what a room materialised I needed to be in that area for personal reasons but that is beside the point I had booked in Inverness Terrace because that was where I wanted to be This was poor stuff and I would like your comments as the booking agents You have always served me well in the past Moira Lawson,0
9213, The Club room an upgrade was very small especially the bathroom It took a bit of getting used to but the pros still outweighed the cons We re coming back in June ,0

9223, The bathroom was small though and a large person would have had very little space in the shower ,0

9227, We were told that our room had been upgraded I would not have liked to stay in the previous one The room was very small and had no air conditioning making it very hot ,0
9228, We did have to move due to not having a double twin as booked But they moved us to a sister hotel in the area included breakfasts and couldn t be more apologetic or helpful ,0
9229, The only thing I would say is the room was very small really not what I expected for a club double Could have have also done with a little decoration in places Might be a good idea to put on the website that the rooms are small One other small thing was that there were complimentary drinks in the fridge but no bottle opener to open them with,0
9230, Tiny rooms and unfortunately I had an unpleasant case with staff on reception My friend left for me a handbag on reception at evening and receptionist promised her to bring it to my number Next day in the morning they ensured me that there was nothing for me left So after spending 20 minutes with all of members on reception they finally found my bag it was directly on the table in front of them I didnt expect that this could happen in London ,0
9231, Yes rooms are compact lol but very clean and to be fair when you visit London you are only really putting your head down so don t actually spend that much time in the room Well I don t anyways ,0
9232, The location is good the building lay out is very nice most of staff are v nice friendly The room was so basic in facilities like tea coffee shower gel body cream which was none The towels bed sheets smell really bad to the extent that I develop skin rashes the mattress pilows were uncomfortable ,0
9233, I booked a club room which in itself was fine along with the little extras but the bathroom The sink was so small Why bother When I leant over to try and brush my teeth and rinse my face the stupidly placed glass shelf above stopped me What idiot designed that Love the hotel but paying for a club room and getting a bathroom cupboard is just not acceptable The bathroom could have been made 1 2 metre wider and had a decent wash basin Puts me off staying again,0
9234, Old style windows were in a fixed position they could not be opened or closed Gaps in the window frames allowed noise from the street to be heard clearly in the room at day and at night Draughts could also be felt coming through the windows The hotel restaurant was only used for breakfast only rather expensive room service was available at other times of the day Handy to have lots of stores and restaurants in the next street so you can pop out and get food for yourself ,0
9235, Having a laugh to describe the room as a deluxe double Open door and immediately faced with a flight of stairs up to the bed area which you had to negotiate separately as no room to swing a cat Bathroom equipment ok but pokey for a deluxe ,0
9236, Working desk space in room not really usable because to small ,0
9237, the size of the room of course we re in London and I ve slept even in smaller rooms but still I can t help but find it extremely annoying can t really have space for the suitcase no minibar and the desk is really impossible to use without feeling contrained There was a nasty damp smell in the room The windows are rather old ok so s the building but the draft coming from outside was not pleasant thankfully the heavy curtains helped ,0
9238, A little cold at night because I did not find the air conditioning regulator until the morning My own fault but the print is small ,0
9239, Breakfast was quite expensive ,0

9244,No Negative,0
9245, Tiny room with no view but at least they made an effort at cheerfulness by placing flowers in the windows that you look out at ,0
9246, There seemed to be huge communication difficulties We asked at booking for two twin rooms or if that was not possible then two single duvets on each double bed Acquiring the single duvets seemed to be the most difficult thing in the world to achieve I lost count of how many attempts it took but it included getting two extra double duvets for each room various doubles and singles and eventually two singles arrived with two duvet covers to put on ourselves not good except they weren t duvet covers they were sheets Two covers were subsequently requested and arrived given to us to put on ourselves except one was a double By this time it was about 12 30am The receptionist was profusely apologetic and offered us complimentary breakfast At breakfast we asked for 1 coffee 2 teas and 1 fruit tea We got 1 coffee and two fruit teas When I pointed out the mistake we were brought 1 more tea At this point we gave up and my daughter and I shared the tea When we were leaving my daughter phoned reception and asked if they could book a taxi to take us to the station but when we arrived downstairs the receptionist said she d forgotten to do it Not good we very nearly missed the train All in all it was quite tiresome ,0
9247, The rooms were small and very tired All needs refurbishment My initial room was so tiny and required going up a few stairs to get to the bed The quilt was too small for the bed and I could hear people talking Asked to change rooms and was given a better room slightly larger which was appreciated Have stayed in better hotels in London for less ,0
9248, Very small bed small shower with a light very close above the showerhead toilet stuck around the side of the shower and a small room to boot also the fire alarm going off at 4 30 45 am just finished things off lovely ,0
9249, Nothing could have been better,0
9250, The bathroom was small so if you are some over 6 foot just be aware there is not much room for you ,0
9251,No Negative,0
9252, The offers did not include breakfast You would rather buy a full package This was an unexpected surprise ,0
9253, The mattress was hard and you could feel the springs And the cornered handrail in the bath was impractical because you keep on catching your back on it,0
9254, Bedroom very small cupboard in wrong place as left small floor space to bed English Language a problem for some staff to understand ,0
9255, Absolutely nothing negative to say ,0
9256, Superior double for 2 Couldn t swing a cat Couldn t even get dressed without hitting the wall with an elbow Quilt just reached edge to edge Would have been a fight for two ,0
9257, I had a lower ground floor and you could hear the underground trains below Not the only hotel to have this though ,0
9258, The bedroom was really cold and had single glazing Apparently we could ve turned the radiators on using the air conditioning That wasn t explained to us and there was no welcome pack in the room Our room was at the front of the hotel and I had a disturbed night s sleep from a lot of noise in the street Also breakfast was so expensive we didn t choose it Finally we chose the delux room supposed to be the bigger option but it was tiny The bedroom door couldn t even open fully ,0
9259, Size of room was small even when I was upgraded rooms due to maintainence issues Size of bathroom also very small Hotel lobby very dark due to original dark wood walls Requires more lighting ,0
9260, Only thing was the room was a little small with no view a brick wall with a picture on it ,0
9261, We were charged too much when checking in and it took us a while before we received the refund back We never received a proper bill to explain what went wrong in the first place even after several times asking for a state of payment ,0
9262, What they call a superior double room is a BOX room I wouldn t recommend staying there if you want a couple of days Also it seems when you arrive reception fill you with a sob story that 38 rooms are out of order so the booking has to be amended even though no prior warning is given via a courtesy call or email they recommend moving you to a sister hotel down the room We put up a bit of a fight saying we didnt want to move and wanted what we booked which ended up being a box room As we were walking away they seem to use this trick on another couple who arirved shortly after claiming there were no rooms for them seems to me they want you to book that specific hotel and when you arrive give you some sob story about the rooms being out of order How many other people have they tried this on It s value for money if you re not messed around ,0
9263, Welcome at Reception wasn t great Room very small would like to know what the standard doubles are like however was ok for 2 nights Bathtube needs bigger screen No mini fridge,0
9264, No opening window or view was probably the only downside but it was a cold few days and to be honest I was staying there while attending a conference so the view wasn t so important ,0
9265, the rooms are far too small for a couple I have asked to have a larger room and the staff accomodated me but the improvement was minimal in the new room ,0
9266, The only real issue for us was the mattress which could have been firmer for more comfort ,0
9267, Room was upgraded to a basement room that wasn t much larger than bed I d hate to have seen my booked room Later discovered that the original person who was to stay in that room complained and was given OUR room We were tripping over ourselves No room for our cases Room smelled of smoke for over a day Staff was very aloof Hade to ask for the iron board and it didn t come the first day ,0
9268, I found x3 body hairs in my bathroom which were not mine This was really not good ,0
9269, Small room for the money paid more was expected Wouldn t recommend for this reason We were told on arrival that we were being given a free upgrade but I hate to think what our original booking was if this was considered an improvement ,0
9270, On arrival we were told we were upgraded to a club room which according to the receptionist was one of their largest rooms When we got to our room is was very small We had barely enough room to walk around the bed We had booked a superior room so I d hate to think how small this would have been Having said that it was very clean and comfortable ,0
9271, Room bathroom quite small which wasn t an issue as we didn t spend much time there Floorboards were very creaky we could hear the guests upstairs moving around Didn t really impact too much on our stay though ,0
9272, This weekend was booked for a gift for my father in laws 70th birthday I saaid this on the booking I was disapponted to know they had a 2 1 2 hour wait for the room and the room was like a box So the whole point of a special weekend was slightly over shadowed,0
9273, Was upgraded to a club room but this was still minute Couldn t walk around the bed Paid more for a family room but extra space was not around the bed Don t try to check in early Staff had poor English ,0
9274, Our ground floor room was very small ,0
9275, Upon arrival we were shifted to a sister hotel because of boiler problems The hotels are rated four star but should be rated two star The tv had bad reception Room service only left body cream and shower gel the first night The room was extremely small and closet space inadequate Breakfast was fair with limited selection ,0
9276, Room was absolutely tiny despite been told we had been upgraded to a Club Room The toilet was far too small especially the actual size of the shower The service in the bar and restaurant was beyond slow and food was bad ,0
9277, Check in process was long Could do with extra staff in busy periods to help out Room was small but not much different in size to the standard London hotel room,0
9278, everything else poor wine in the evening cold room heating wasn t working on a sub zero February night no where to box and a box room you couldn t swing a cat in,0
9279, I hated the bathroom Taking a shower was so hard the room was so tiny we couldn t fit despite it wasnt the smallest room Staff was not very welcoming ,0
9280, Size of the bed and room Reception staff weren t very attentive while trying to check in she served 3 or 4 people while I was trying to pay ,0
9281, Rooms were small but still everything you need was there Didn t realise how much you could squeeze into the tiniest bathroom I have ever seen ,0
9282, The size of the room was a bit tight for 2 adults but yet sufficient for good rest ,0
9283, I don t approve of the staff removing plates from the table when the other person is still eating The British way is both plates are removed at the same time I found this made my experience of my meal very uncomfortable which is a shame because the food was lovely ,0
9284, I didht luke the rooms r very tiny and i didht like the reception girl martha which when i ask her to change room ahe lie to me and she told me is overbooked and dont have other room but when i speak with the manager suddenly she washt overbooked the hotel and i change room ,0
9285, Rooms were awful Hotel pulls you in with the nice looking lobby them boom Your trapped in a small box that s barely of 1 quality Also hotel cancelled first reservation so while I was half way to London I had to book another room wish I d booked a different hotel as that should have been a sign Very disappointed,0
9286, The bathroom was not clean enough The windows were not well insulated so cold air kept creeping under them The bathroom smell was musky the ventilation was not working ,0
9287, Nothing to add here ,0
9288, Mould around window and window was dirty and also couldnt get in safe in wardrobe as the bed amd side cabinet was too close,0
9289, Room was smaller than expected bathroom was very cramped in particular and shower was rubbish ,0
9290, On arrival the hotel room was not clean I was very disappointed also it did ruin my evening In saying that the way it was dealt with was brilliant I am extremely grateful for the night manager and some of the staff as they made it right as soon as they could ,0
9291, The room a Deluxe double was just off the main staircase with a potentially injurious lack of space between the door to the room and the door to the staircase The window looked out on the acces ramp of an underground car park and service entrances to restaurants on Queensway making it noisy and insalubrious Deluxe is not a word I would have used ,0
9292, There was no space under the bed for my to hide and prank my girlfriend,0
9293,No Negative,0
9294, Bedroom very small Clean and comfortable with nice bathroom but small ,0
9295, I think this may be a London wide problem and I also have good hearing but I could hear the tube from my room on the ground floor throughout the night and morning The room could have been a bit cleaner I think the turn around is very busy There seemed to be a constant flow of guests which must put staff under pressure it lacked the finish I expect of a hotel and shows the difference between a 4 London hotel and 5 There was a slight mix up with our room but The manager and staff were more than accommodating to resolve this and went above and beyond to make it right and they improved my stay by doing so I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely use again the next time I return to London Any points I didn t like are simply little things ,0
9296, N A,0
9297, Breakfast was overpriced for what you got and the room was very small ,0
9298, N A We didn t stay there long enough to notice anything we didn t like ,0
9299, Rooms nice but small drinks expensive and overpriced,0
9300, The rooms were small however for the amount of time we spent there it really didnt matter Location way more important beds were comfortable and it was spotlessly clean ,0
9301, We had problems with our pram and there was no lift available for us to the first floor so the stairs were a nightmare followed by more steps as you enter the tiny cramped bedroom Not child friendly or suitable for disabled access ,0
9302, The double bed was something else The mattress was extremely hard we hardly slept at all The bedcover was very thin and not wide enough to cover two people We would not stay there again ,0
9303, The only thing that could have been better was the floor in the room was incredibly loud when we walked on it Other than that we had a fantastic time ,0
9304, Creaky floors but only to be expected given the age of the property ,0
9305, Room was very small wardrobe was tiny no shower curtain meant bathroom floor got soaked every time the shower was on wallpaper was being applied to the corridors during our entire stay ,0
9306, Room was tiny hardly enough space to walk round the bed on one side Bedding and towels were tired not of the quality expected in a 4 hotel ,0

9308, Problems with holding deposits for hotel Room we stayed in on second floor one side of corridor bit small for a couple staying Smell of smoke in room ,0

9310, Room quite small could nt make water empty from bath tiny bathroom ,0
9311, They had called me before I arrived to Transfer me to another hotel because they have a maintenance work but I refused It took me 10 minutes to check in My room was deluxe but they upgrade it to club room which was so small the bathroom area was about 0 5 M by 1 M the sink was so small like a large soup plate and its was hard to adjust the tube to get warm water No phone signal at all because my room was in basement ,0

9411, The cost of the smallest room we have ever had in London We asked at the end of the stay why our water was not replenished and was informed only the first day was included in the price unless you are a club member We believe that for in excess of 500 pounds for a 72 hour stay bottled water would be included The fruit was a nice touch but removed when left and not replaced it would of been nice to leave it for the following day The basis of this hotels prices seems to be the grand entrance as the remained of the hotel is a very dated ,0

9492, Very small room with no space at all so it is hard to move The room we stayed in had a very small window at the top which you could not even open so the room itself was a bit dark and stuffy It felt a like living in a basement Furthermore you can hear everything through the walls for example when guests in a room above you wake up you can hear their steps If your breakfast is not included in a room rate make sure you pro actively ask the reception for a cheaper pre booked option when checking in Otherwise you are not informed pay more for the same when just coming for a breakfast in the morning and may have unpleasant surprise when checking out and discovering it At that moment nothing can be done as it is in the system already ,0
9493, room to small for a double it did not feel like a deluxe room difficult to communicate with some of the staff,0
9494, Nothing,0
9495, The bedroom did not match the description on the website it was tiny and the bathroom was so small it was actually difficult to move in there We also paid extra for a club room but this just seemed to mean a bowl of fruit and a small bottle of wine were left in the room It was not the luxurious pampering advertised ,0

9504, The rooms on the ground floor are very cold because of huge old windows the noice isolation is very bad very noisy The rooms are very small ,0
9505, rooms are very small related to the amount paid it is too expensive comparing with 4 stars hotels i paid over 150 pound night that a very high cost for this tiny room food and beverage are expensive they offer me to pay 80 pound for breakfast and i didn t not get it of course i am not in four seasons hotel so it is my only complain that the cost is too high related to what i get room size and food ,0
9506, The adequacy of the room size appears to be pot luck The room I was in for the second period of my stay was much better than the first see my other review following the first period of my stay ,0

9511, The temperature of the room and no air con The bathroom was very small with a sliding door and was very close to the first bed The shower would drench the whole bathroom floor ,0
9512, Unfortunately there is nothing Grand or Royal about this hotel I had room 404 The floor creaked the ceiling creaked as people in the room above me moved around The room was not clean old grubby fingermarks on both sides of the bathroom door weeks of dirt on the washbasin lamps corners of the bathroom hadn t been cleaned Housekeeping woke me up and walked in at 08 00am then back again at 09 00am even though checkout is specified as 12 00 noon I had an upgraded room to superior and it was tiny 25cms between the bed and the wall window God knows how small a standard deluxe room is ,0
9513, not royal not grand the rooms are very small like prison cell not enough space for luggage maintenance very bad ,0
9514, Arriving after a 14 hs flight and being told my room was sold to sb else and no longer available even having my credit card as a guarantee After 20 minutes i got another room for extra price after complainig some more the extra charges were removed from my bill but this procedure is unacceptable Front desk and reservation department needs plenty of training in good manners and hotel service ,0
9515, Dreadfully noisy Woken up very early sunday morning by people servicing building adjacent Don t stay on this side of hotel,0
9516, The superior room wasn t It was adequate but compact Lack of restaurant ,0
9517, when I booked the room through Booking com I thought I was going to have the superior room on arrival I was given the club room BOX the shower was so tight I was not able to turn round it was that tight the wardrobe was in the worst place by the door which was not helpful on entering the room I thought the cost of the room was expensive as it was not the room I had booked with Booking com,0
9518, The staff who dealt with the initial arrival and stringent way they dealt with the hotel policy when they had no authority for specific information The misinformation the staff gave in relation to credit card provider and details of the credit card being passed to their finance dept when not authorised ,0
9519, The room was really quite small but for 108 per night from wowcher it was worth it considering the location There was quite a bit of noise in the early hours as the room was at the back of the hotel and backed onto shops getting they re deliveries etc And the air con heating didn t work properly flashed on the wall until I covered it with a towel Also the sink plug wouldn t close for my partner to have a shave in There was no view as the window was frosted we didn t eat in hotel maybe next time,0
9520, Room just too small particularly if you have any luggage and who doesn t ,0
9521, The bathrooms were a tad small I had a bathtub my friend had a shower and the one with the shower was tiny Breakfast was good but expensive ,0
9522, Do not stay here I had a single room I didn t mind the small size of it however the bedroom AC only sent out hot air even though it was set at 17 degrees the plumbing in the bathroom made noise all night and there was a green light in the hallway ceiling that was too bright and lit up the room at night A really uncomfortable experience I got about 3 hours sleep ,0
9523, Rooms were small We had a club room which had only a double bed with very little space around it There was a curious little area by the windows with a desk which had no heating though you could close it off with a curtain Bathroom was very small with a tiny washbasin and shower no bath ,0
9524, I thought the size of the room on arrival to be small disappointing misleading at time of booking The room didn t smell very clean I asked to be moved ,0
9525, Against the positives the hotel has some clear minuses starting from the size of the rooms we had booked a double deluxe room and we found ourselves in a ridiculously minuscule room where two people can hardly move at the same time and the bathroom was at best 4sq m As a side note one of the two lifts has been permanently out of service which made the waiting time to go up and down unbearably long A final warning for future possible customers some of the rooms the hotel offers are in the basement if you are unlucky enough to be assigned one of those rooms when checking in watch out you don t want to be there ,0
9526, did not have a bad experience at all the only recommendation would be to have a larger shower ,0

9531, Room was as big as a shoe There wasn t even enough room to open the little foldable rack that you lay your suitcase on although there was one in the room,0
9532, The rooms were incredibly small It was difficult for two people to sleep on a double bed we literally had to hop around the room There isn t even any space to open your bag I know rooms in London and specially in zone 1 are small I have lived in other hotels in central London as well but the room here were a big disappointment ,0

9538, Sheeets had spots it was all very dusty and the room was very tiny The girl at the reception was really rude The room was not serviced in the morning and when I returned to the hotel at 11 pm I found it as I had left in the morning ,0
9539, The only little complaint I have is you need to clean the bathroom doors more often Mine was sticky The rest of the room was very clean though ,0
9540, We were given two single beds pushed together rather than the double that we thought we had booked The room was a bit of a dungeon might suit some but for this couple it was not a happy outcome to a romantic evening ,0
9541, despite booking this Hotel in January we were given rooms at top of hotel classed as Superior rooms They were more like attic rooms You could not walk around the small double bed However we were given complimentary breakfast ,0
9542, Bar closes too early in the evenings Bar decor was a bit shabby and tired Single room although comfortable I felt in an exposed and remote situation at the back of the hotel The double lock on the door did not work and the safety chain could easily be broken if door forced ,0
9543, The noise on top Our room was below the conference and they did not move us when they had an event They were moving the furnitures and fixing the Mir conference room till 5am and we had hardly any sleep We kept on complaining but they only stopped early morning and started early ,0
9544,No Negative,0
9545, Bedroom was very small and cramped with one side of double bed against a wall and not much space on other side for anything other than walking to bathroom Small desk at base of bed but not enough space to sit at the desk I was traveling alone so just needed somewhere to sleep ,0

9551, Small room But it is London ,0
9552, The staff is not polite and cannot even take the pain of answering to a good morning The rooms are ridiculously small and dirty The bathroom is simply a joke 1m This hotel is not worth even 1 star,0
9553, We arrived at Royale Hotel at Hyde Park where they took my payment for the room It was only after they took my payment that they then told us that there was maintenance issues within the building so they would have to re locate us to another hotel in Paddington They paid for our taxi but told us the taxi would be with us in 5 mins however we were made to wait 30 mins before i had to again ask the staff how long it would be The hotel itself was really nice just the whole point of us having to be re located after i had already made payment was not acceptable ,0
9554, Our room was nice but was a little cramped trying to walk around the bed the TV didn t have good reception ,0
9555, I had a ground floor room The view was of a brick wall and at times you could hear the tube arriving departing although it didnt disturb my sleep The rooms are very small ,0
9556, Upon arrival there was one person at the desk who was on the phone which is understandable however after 5 minutes of not even any eye contact as acknowledgment and a mobile phone ringing constantly behind the desk as it was not switched on silent we were then greeted She told us our room was not ready so we could have a club room in the basement if we liked We did appreciate the upgrade from a double room but we still found it to be quite small When entering the room I immediately noticed the black marks all over the walls My partner then noticed a huge crack in the toilet seat I turned on the air con and dust visibly flew out so I ran my fingers over it and found that it indeed was covered in dust After informing the front desk and upon return to our room I was pleased to see the toilet seat was replaced and air con cleaned I decided to have a bath and noticed the plug was broken so in order to drain the water after my bath I had to annoyingly fiddle with it Then when flushing the toilet the actual button stuck and constantly flushed until I forced it to pull back out On my first night I had ordered and orange juice and glass of prosecco my orange juice which was visibly not being used anymore due to the water floating on top of it and the Orange juice sunken to the bottom was left and was still there when we were checking out I proceeded to write my comments in the leaflet provided After I finished writing I turned to the back of the leaflet and to top it off it was covered in some sort of sticky substance which just added to my frustration We looked at a range of hotels and chose yours as it is truly beautiful from the outside and seemed like somewhere we could enjoy staying at However we didn t even want to drink in the bar or relax in our room because we were that disappointed My partner was extremely unhappy too as this getaway was a gift for me Overall unfortunately this was not an enjoyable experience from start to finish ,0
9557, I know it was in a deal but the room was very small It was at the end of the top floor corridor in the eaves ,0
9558, Do not order room service We ordered two panini s in the evening One Cheese Chicken and the other Cheese Pepperoni This was to come with a side salad and crisps This was a simple choice and we expected nothing fancy However when the dish arrived the panini was soggy and had also somehow been strewn over the plate the bottom of the panini stayed on one side the filling on the plate and the top of the panini had been squashed on the other side It looked as though a child had been playing with our food before it even arrived I took the food down to show the manager only to be told that that is how a panini should look I said I have eaten many panini s over the time and this is not how a panini should look the chef came and said oh I dont know how a panini should look I dont eat them This wasnt really the response I was hoping for So just to make you aware please dont order the room service you will be disappointed ,0

9564, Maybe I haven t got my head around London pricing yet but I couldn t understand why a glass of red wine and a bacardi coke in the Theater bar should cost considerably more than a breakfast We did get better value in bars located nearer the hotel ,0
9565, Deluxe Double Room is grossly misrepresented in the hotel s online advertising over a nine day stay my room was never cleaned properly and if luckily the bedding which was old and worn may have been changed 1 time On several occasions I saw the Front Desk Staff engage in quite unpleasant discussions with guests who arrived to find that their booking had to been honoured or those like myself who were very unhappy with the accommodation I was promised an upgrade to a Club Room after 1 night but the Front Desk never followed up on this ,0
9566, Nothing negative to say but if I was forced to give something it would be that the pillows are hard and uncomfortable ,0
9567, the room size is terrible small for us from ASIA to LONDON cant stay in this hotel because we cant even open one luggage No space to walk around and even place your products or hang your clothes the room is even smaller than JAPAN room I think winter period not advise for long haul flight to stay here do not have the space to place or even pack thing we need to hop around dam funny for us we are consider petite sizes and we need to hop around the room hahaha good work out for us this hotel is good for 3 days 2 nites short stay with one small bag ,0
9568, One small thing that could be improved is the glass shower screen on the bath shower was not big enough ,0
9569, Difficult to get around the bed duvet too small lovely view of the bins from neighbouring shops,0
9570, Decor is dreadfully bland and whole place feels soul less The reception and bar are particularly small and totally lacking in comfort not even enough chairs It is a beautiful old building but has been badly modernised and in no way is this a four star hotel APART from the great staff ,0
9571, A little expensive for the average traveller We were last minute booking or would have chosen elsewhere in the area They tried to bill us for breakfast we didn t have and very disorganized on check out ,0

9574, We were in room 026 Very noisy from 7am Doors banging constantly we could constantly hear the bleeping of a key pad followed by another door banging We had asked for a quiet room Also a small point re the wardrobe Hanging space not long enough for clothes perhaps one shelf should be taken out ,0
9575, Pricing of a single person 3 5x2 m room adjacent small shower was unreasonable I don t know how the picture of the bed was made It must have been made before they built the walls around the room Could not have been more than 50 cm between bed and wall on one side only Had to stack furniture on the cabinet to have access to bed from bathroom Unpractical cabinet to stow luggage while there was no room to leave it in the room ,0
9576, i booked a double room for 2 person but when i reached on that day they gave us 2 single room due to some maintenance problem of them yet still changed us to other property with double room ,0

9585, Although we were advised we had received an upgrade on our room our room was tiny Felt very claustrophobic especially in the bathroom e g very tight squeeze getting out of the shower hit my knee on the sink the first day Net curtains were dirty window broken and had a horrible view of a dirty alley from our window If this was the upgrade I dread to think what our original room would have been like For a 4 star hotel and the amount we paid I would not have expected any of these things ,0
9586,No Negative,0
9587, We had to climb a narrow staircase and walk along very narrow corridors to our room The room was too small for its description as a Superior Double If we had not benefited from a big room rate discount we should have been very dissatisfied ,0
9588, the rooms are a bit worn down and showing their age For the price and location its still a good deal ,0
9589, Bed very uncomfortable on last night for some strange reason Fine for rest of stay Spoilt the overall impression ,0
9590, The staff is friendly but not well organised They kept us waiting in front of them in the lobby for almost 2 hours for our room over the announced checkin time ,0
9591, Simple things the duvet was far too small for the bed The coffee and sugar were not replenished when asked When having a shower the screen was so small that water went all over the floor ,0
9592, Room very very small I booked a double and it felt claustrophobic for 1 glad there wasnt 2 of us No restaurant and room service menu limited Room needed redecorating and as an older female I would have appreciated a little help with my luggage up and down front steps No porter and reception ignored me I am a regular visitor to London and usually stay 4 5 star and I just feel grand royal could do better,0
9593, The room was very small and was quite stifling with no opening windows or room air conditioning ok for 1 night,0
9594, I choose a club room which I paid a little more for however although it had everything you would expect it was quite small with a window only 2 foot wide ,0

9598, We requested them to change to a suite on day one since rooms were very small and they did not give us one ,0
9599, The only thing we didn t like is one of the managers on duty during the day showed very little concern for the customer Awful to have to deal with Fortunately the rest of the staff made up for him ,0

9602, Room could be bigger but I can t complain given its ideal location in London ,0

9621, I would have liked breakfast to have been included in our stay We were offered it at a reduced rate but it would have been easier if it was included in the initial price as an option ,0
9622, Fire alarm kept going off plugs did not work one morning and staff did not know the jogging route mentioned in the hotel guest guide Rooms not serviced promptly and at our convenience,0
9623, Upon arrival we had to wait 10 minutes in the rain before someone could help us bring our 7 suitcases up the stairs into the reception area We had booked and paid for two of the same rooms as we were a group of 4 people One of our rooms were a downgrade from the other the rooms did not have the same appliances and one room had less space than the other We asked to be moved so we could both have the same room type and they said yes but never got round to it We had to wait over an hour for some ice buckets We found a thick long transparent plastic string in one of plates of breakfast and the restaurant staff actually looked into my hair and told me it was my hair because nobody in the kitchen has that hair We accidentally dropped salmon on our bed sheets and it smelt really bad so we asked if we could have a new duvet They gave us an uncovered single duvet for our double bed so when we asked for a double the night porter gave us the same dirty salmon duvet that we had put on the floor outside the room When we confronted him about it he shouted you cannot expect us to clean the bedding everyday My card was overcharged by 264 when I had checked out When I rang the hotel to let them know they said it s not their fault it s my bank When I called my bank they had given me 2 preauth codes proving the hotel were holding an extra 264 from my card and they had to fax my bank to allow the to cancel it The manager was unable to use his own fax machine so he sent me the fax letter through email and he made it my duty to get it faxed to a bank They are highly unprofessional and I will never ever stay at this hotel again It is appauling and disgusting ,0

9632, The rooms are very small I booked a deluxe double room which is supposed to be bigger than a superior double room but it is difficult to imagine a room smaller than the one I had There was not enough space to get out of one side of the double bed The fire alarm went off at 4am not the hotel s fault but the following night I was kept awake by faulty door chimes which I couldn t stop from flashing green and red it was like trying to sleep in a night club ,0
9633, The wifi kept clicking off and there was only one shower gel but over all amazing,0
9634, The fire alarm went off at 4am It was chaos No one knew what to do Proper legal protocol was not followed Poor communication from the staff And not one word of an apology until we brought it up the next morning It spoilt out overnight stay The hotel could be fabulous Just staff and decor in some rooms let it down ,0

9647, Deluxe double was a VERY small room could barely walk around the bed the ceilings were also low on 6th floor so when I was in shower I nearly hit my head on ceiling and I m only 5 foot 4 there were no special out of ordinary touches eg refrigeration guest robes iron or board in room there was a kettle and blow dryer it was clean however I would rate this a 3 star,0
9648, Read my comment above,0
9649, Unable to take a shower without soaking the tiny bathroom ,0
9650, Bar closes early for a Saturday Room was very small and although it was on 1st floor wasn t possible to open window Maids are very noisy in the morning,0
9651, Our room was hidden away in the basement but then it was one of the cheaper rooms ,0
9652, the 1st night was terrible we were arranged to a single room in the basement where our luggages couldn t be opened because of the limited spaces When we opened our room you need to walk up the stairs really terrible But we paid over 2000 dollars HOng kong Very unhappy and disappointed We complained and the manager upgraded us to club room which was acceptable for the rest of my stay ,0
9653, At first a staff gave me a room on first floor that i had to walk up many stairs and through a long corridor with my big heavy luggage Luckily another lady arranged a room on ground floor for me that made me feel more comfortable ,0
9654, Duvet too small for comfort told we could request for down pillows n bedding never came bed softer than most other places we ve stayed in london bed n bedding duvet pillows poor sub standard quality does not match to your hotel image Quite disappointing Bedroom though small is expected but configuration awkward opens bathroom door to block access to basin tight n squeezy even for one Really need to look into that ,0
9655, Rooms was very compact and didn t look four star which was a shame as the hotel itself was gorgeous and staff fantastic,0
9656, The room was just far too small to justify the price tag Not enough room for one let alone two suitcases The bathroom was more like a broom closet ,0
9657, No open windows Open door to accommodation to be greeted by five steps Also does not overlook hyde park as advertised,0
9658, The rooms are little small but i think for the money i paid I got the best value Good job Grand Royal hotel ,0
9659, On check in we was told we had to be relocated due to a maintenance issue The chap who dealt with this didn t do so in the best manner what upset us the most was the hotel option was not as good and cheaper than yours and when I said we will cancel and I would book elsewhere myself we was allowed to stay This ruined our start to our stay Marks on all bedroom walls and a toe nail clipping on bedroom Carpet small bedroom also ,0
9660, Very small rooms just fit a double bed with small staircase to the bathroom which was tiny I guess its because of the location which was excellent,0
9661, For the third time I was bumped out of the hotel upon arrival to another in the group The other hotel had a lift out of order the TV worked when the porter shook it and a large bathroom towel hook fell off the wall on my foot I am fed up with not being able to stay at the hotel I booked and I am meant to be on their partner frequent stay list What was worse while waiting for a taxi to go to other hotel they were booking other solo travellers in ,0
9662, Despite being upgraded to club the room was tiny and the window opened to the staff entrance which was noisy and busy with people smoking I asked to email the manager but no email was sent to me with his contact details ,0
9663, small rooms and expensive as far as quality and price is concerned,0
9664, the bedroom was small in spite of being told we were getting an upgrade it makes me wonder what the downgrade was like the bed itself was uncomfortable,0
9665, Towels were rough ,0
9666, The initial room we had was very small and we had to upgrade to a bigger one The mattress felt as if it was very old as it was extremely soft and the springs felt broken ,0
9667, The room was tiny Just enough space to walk around the bed There was a computer that guest could use but the printer s cartridge was depleted and it was not changed after a request to do so ,0
9668, However the rooms were compact and we were asked on arrival if we wanted to upgrade for free to a club room which was bigger than the room we had booked The club room turned out to be compact and the bath was tiny No view as it was on the lower ground floor Wouldn t stay here again ,0
9669, We were transferred to a sister hotel as the boiler wasn t working The alternate hotel is advertised as 4 star I don t think this rating was gained via the normal national rating system as it doesn t come close to other 4 star rated hotels I have stayed in It does not meet the high standard expected of a 4 star The bedroom was small and cramped the room smelt and the bathroom was worn tattered unclean and the breakfast was average It was a real disappointment ,0
9670, The rooms were a little on the small side but adequate Can t say anything negative as it has great location clean rooms and friendly and helpful staff ,0
9671, Room was a little small for U S standards but I was expecting it to be much smaller based on previous reviews very comfortable size for a European hotel Pillows were a little hard and creeking floors from guests in room above were at times annoying but very minor No shower curtain but that s a European thing ,0
9672,No Negative,0
9673, Paid the supplement for the larger deluxe room but still very compact in size ,0
9674, We were put into the Park Grand paddington as the grand royale had a water problem We had paid for a superior double but our room was so small we couldn t even stand up next to each other in it A truly awful hotel ,0

10001, No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam ,1
10002, Location was good and staff were ok It is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice Will go back ,1
10003, Great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area The building also has quite some character ,1

10010, Rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building Pictures are of room 300 The true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly Also the bath was lovely and big and inviting Great more for couples Restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of Amsterdam Would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too ,1
10011, Style location rooms,1
10012, Comfy bed good location ,1
10013, This hotel is being renovated with great care and with an appreciation for its unique structure and location My spacious and comfortable room had a large double paned glass window onto the lush greenery of the park The breakfast selection was spectacular All considered this was a great hotel for the price and I plan to return ,1
10014, It was very good very historic building that s why I chose it ,1
10015, This hotel is awesome I took it sincirely because a bit cheaper but the structure seem in an hold church close to one awesome park Arrive in the city are like 10 minutes by tram and is super easy The hotel inside is awesome and really cool and the room is incredible nice with two floor and up one super big comfortable room I ll come back for sure there The staff very gentle one Spanish man really really good ,1
10016, Great onsite cafe Amazing building Park location Amazing Bobby Gin and Tonic ,1
10017, We loved the location of this hotel The fact that it is set in a Park away from the busy centre of dam square was great The tram system was brilliant and easy to handle The hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from Ireland ,1
10018, Public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt Its an old building and clearly has old building issues ,1
10019, I liked the hotels history And for such an enormous hotel I can t imagine how many girls were orphaned I liked their breakfast It was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs Juices tea and coffee ,1
10020, Friendly staff OostPark a few yards away Good continental breakfast selection Quiet and relaxing area ,1
10021, The breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet We did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional We had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location ,1
10022, The location is good You need 15min to 20min walk to the center depends on your speed The hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design The bed was really comfortable ,1
10023, Bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly ,1
10024, Lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed We stayed in the split level room which we really liked If you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level The Oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from You can get the Metro close by 8min walk or the Tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the Hotel All in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower Tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central Amsterdam We will be returning ,1

10036, the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park,1
10037, Very nice hotel located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed ,1
10038, The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam,1
10039, Location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good ,1

10094, Beautifull buiding next to Oosterpark Friendly staff Great breakfast ,1
10095, Great room very comfortable bed Nice and quiet Fantastic decor and amazing staircases The location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour The immediate area is fantastic great Park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available Near by brewery that do tours not Heineken and great beer Good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center ,1

10111, Generally clean and interestingly designed But a little worn Meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process The reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots ,1
10112, Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The rooms are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level ,1

10212, Great location lovely room,1
10213, Very nice property stylish hotel friendly staff spacious rooms except the one with stairs and close to the city center just a couple of stops by tram ,1
10214, Boutique atmosphere good size rooms with comfortable beds and stylishly designed bathrooms ,1
10215, It was a well kept hotel in a lovely area The staff and services offered were excellent We felt it was a great value Our beautiful room with a view was a bonus ,1
10216, The hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on Oosterpark which is awesome The location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and 5 10 mins to POI convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city You can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about 20 30mins Very clean room made and towels changed everyday Almost perfect ,1
10217, Crews being nice and helpful Environment quiet and peaceful but unfortunately certain areas under construction ,1
10218, The bathroom and sofa are so good The building style is really awesome ,1

10220, I loved the hotel design and decoration Staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling That is something you really appreciate when you are on a 24 hour business trip Breakfast was way better than I expected although coffee was quite bad That is something most hotels fail to nail and I think most guests find it important Rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable ,1

10226, Although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding The hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space I was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside Fantastic value for money but I assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in Amsterdam The bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite The hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of Amsterdam in only 7 10 minutes ,1
10227, Great bed bathroom beer garden decor staff and food ,1
10228, This is a fantastic place to stay and felt like true luxury despite the amazingly cheap price that we paid for our stay There is work going on at the moment but we were given free drinks which were delicious and would both love to return to see the hotel when all the work is finished as it is such a fantastic place to stay that is steeped with history Also the shower was incredible ,1

10654, Staff were indifferent and sullen I was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience I left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on 9 seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping I got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and I never heard from them about my items Ever They also gave me a 20 year old folding cot bed with a 1 mattress to sleep on for 3 nights I Would have thought 1000 plus for 3 nights would have afforded me a bed Yes I complained and they relented eventually Although the location is fantasticly placed I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away ,1

12013, Very handy location to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express and in the pretty Paddington area This hotel is clean and comfortable if a little dated The staff are wonderful thank you And the English breakfast was excellent Not a fancy and extensive breakfast buffet but a tasty and well cooked meal Equally food on the room service menu was tasty and fresh Good Indian and European cuisine ,1
12014, The room was small but we knew that before arrival I just didn t think that paying an extra 40 for a room that I wasn t going to spend much time in warranted it The wardrobe didn t mark sense as it was so thin you couldn t actually hang anything in it The hairdryer was in the wardrobe and the mirror on the back of the door that didn t open wide enough to look in to blow dry your hair Parking was a nightmare as you have to park 10 minutes away and trudge back with your luggage This wasn t mentioned before booking I wish the hotel would have had a link to booking which is under Waitrose and was 40 for two night The price wasn t that bad it was just the nightmare of walking back and forth with luggage The location was good close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate we walked to oxford street as it was so close and the weather was fab ,1

12024, The space is good for a family of 4 The bathroom is clean with all required supplies There is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron ,1
12025, The hotel location is excellent It is super close to the Paddington train and tube stations It is near to places to eat food stores and pharmacy You walk three streets south and you are next to the Hyde Park Kensington Gardens gate I had breakfast at their restaurant two days in a row and the food was good and a good selection of items My room did not have an iron and ironing board in it but it was made available by the staff right away ,1

13786, Room was lovely and extremelly quiet especially after 11pm you can keep you window wide open and wont hear a sound They gave us a smartphone for free to use while we stay there was free 4g internet and free calls over the Europe and North America it helped alot to keep in touch with a family and dont get lost in Paris Staff was really nice stayed proffessional even after asking some silly questions like how the light turns on because we didnt knew that you need your room card to turn it on It is litterally 5minutes from Arc de Triopmhe which lights up wounderfully at the night and even you can pay 10 euro to get on top of it and you can see a Paris from there its absolutely beutiful Metro station is nearby which speeded up our travel instead of walking we took metro a ticket is about 2euro but it can bring you anywhere Really nice location highly recommended ,1

18360, The location and price was great Rooms in London are generally small so make sure you pay attention to which size room you pick If you book the smallest square footage room you will probably be disappointed with the size Don t pre pay breakfast during check in for the first morning if you might be jet lagged It ends at 10 AM and you probably will oversleep ,1

18400, The location was wonderful Near public transportation as well as within walking distance to several important tourist sites The public spaces inside the building registration lobby etc were absolutely fabulous just as beautiful as the pictures on their website That s why I picked this hotel In my price range ALL the hotel rooms in London were extremely small but the Grand Royale London Hyde Park had the gorgeous common areas that set it apart from the rest The rooms were clean the staff very nice and the breakfast was delicious ,1
18401, The hotel was conveniently close to Hyde Park where we liked to walk It was close to two tube stations bus route and taxi services A convenience store was close by The hotel is a lovely old London town house style and the reception hall and public areas I would describe as Baronial The staff were attentive and polite and the lady on duty at reception was particularly thoughtful and kindly Our room was very clean and tidy though rather small for two people that said we were quite comfortable ,1
18402, Staff was very friendly and helpful and responded quickly to requests and questions The English breakfast was well stocked and a good value for the cost The history behind the hotel was interesting The lobby library and theater bar were beautifully decorated and took us back in time ,1

18404, Park across street Bus and Tube very close The hotel has a nice welcoming fruit basket with chocolates and wine Coffee and tea supplied ,1
18405, The room was tastefully decorated and well appointed The facilities such as lighting and bathroom were excellent However it was slightly too small,1
18406, As it was my girlfriend s 30th birthday the reception staff very kindly gave us a free room upgrade to a shoebox sized room I can only assume our original room was the size of a matchbox A plus point was the free to use smart phone in the room although we didn t use it for fear of the cost involved if it was lost broken stolen while we were out and about ,1
18407, We stayed at the only magnificent suite in the hotel We loved the overdone heritage feel and big space both in the suite and bathroom We were 3 adults and one toddler in this suite Breakfast was great as well and the location right next to Hyde park and Kensington gardens is perfect for kids Mommies can go shopping on the Westbourne grove ,1
18408, 1 Welcome service for honeymoon was so touched 2 Luxurious atmosphere at reception area 3 Close from the tube station ,1
